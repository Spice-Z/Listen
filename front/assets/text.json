The latest news, seven days a week.\n\n00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.800\nBBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.\n\n00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.000\nIt's late night in London and we're recording an emergency episode of AmeriCast,\n\n00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.480\nwith the news that Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 charges.\n\n00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.120\nWe're going to be talking about what this means for Trump, for the Democrats and Republicans,\n\n00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.720\nand how it shifts the state of play for the 2024 election.\n\n00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.200\nYou can hear all of the analysis on AmeriCast,\n\n00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.080\njust search for it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.\n\n00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.040\nThis is a special edition of the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.\n\n00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.600\nI'm Charlotte Gallagher and at three hours GMT on Wednesday the 5th of April,\n\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.840\nthis is an update on the criminal charges brought against the former US President Donald Trump.\n\n00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.240\nShortly before we recorded this podcast, Mr Trump addressed his supporters at his Mar-a-Lago retreat\n\n00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.640\nin Florida, describing the case as election interference and saying his only crime had\n\n00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.800\nbeen to defend America from those who would destroy it. Earlier at a hearing in New York,\n\n00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.520\nhe pleaded not guilty to all 34 charges brought against him, accusing him of falsifying business\n\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.280\nrecords to hide damaging information during the 2016 presidential election.\n\n00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.560\nWe'll report from New York, Florida and the traditional Republican stronghold of Arizona.\n\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.720\nEven by the standards of his four at times tumultuous years in office,\n\n00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.520\nit's been an extraordinary day for Donald Trump and America.\n\n00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.320\nHe made history by becoming the first serving or former US President to appear in court charged\n\n00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.640\nwith criminal offences. At the hearing in New York, he pleaded not guilty to the 34 charges\n\n00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.280\nfiled against him. They relate to three hush money payments ahead of the 2016 election,\n\n00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.600\nincluding one to the porn star Stormy Daniels. Mr Trump later flew back to Florida and addressed\n\n00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.320\nsupporters at his Mar-a-Lago mansion.\n\n00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.000\nThe only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who\n\n00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.360\nseek to destroy it.\n\n00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.040\nFrom the beginning, the Democrats spied on my campaign, remember that?\n\n00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.800\nThey attacked me with an onslaught of fraudulent investigations. Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine,\n\n00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.080\nUkraine, Ukraine. Impeachment hoax number one. Impeachment hoax number two. The illegal and\n\n00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.720\nunconstitutional raid on Mar-a-Lago right here.\n\n00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.840\nOur correspondent Barbara Pletosha was at Mar-a-Lago to hear Mr Trump's speech.\n\n00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.440\nHe was back to his regular platform with his regular crowd and I think he seemed heartened\n\n00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.040\nby their cheers and their claps. But he also actually seemed pretty intense and angry still\n\n00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.160\nthroughout the speech. And he did talk about, of course, the New York investigation, saying\n\n00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.760\nseveral times that it was aimed at interfering in the 2024 election and lashing out at the\n\n00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.720\ndistrict attorney who brought it. But he didn't actually talk about it very much. He did talk\n\n00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.360\nabout other cases. He talked at some length about the case involving the classified documents\n\n00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.280\nthat he brought from the White House here to Mar-a-Lago and got some good boos from\n\n00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.280\nthe crowd about that. And he talked about the Georgia case, which is this investigation\n\n00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.680\ninto whether he tried to overturn the election in that state. So it could be that he's more\n\n00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.000\nconcerned about the implication of those cases than this one.\n\n00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.360\nEarlier in the day, prosecutors in Manhattan said they'd identified a man who was a member\n\n00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.800\nof the Republican Party. The judge in Manhattan said they'd identified serious criminal conduct\n\n00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.760\nby the former president and would lay out their case at trial. Analysts suggest that\n\n00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.400\ncould begin early next year. From New York, Gary O'Donohue reports.\n\n00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.360\nTrump 24! Trump 24! Trump 24!\n\n00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.920\nThis was a day like no other in American history. A former president up before a judge on criminal\n\n00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.520\ncharges. In the crowds of protesters, both pro and anti-Trump, and the world's media,\n\n00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.960\nMr Trump's motorcade snaked its way from Trump Tower to the courtroom where he spent\n\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.520\naround two hours. Having railed against the proceedings in public, Mr Trump wore a sober,\n\n00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.840\nserious expression in the courtroom itself, speaking quietly to enter not guilty pleas\n\n00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.960\nand 34 charges brought against him. The charges relate to falsifying business records in combination\n\n00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.880\nwith an attempt to contravene New York state election law. What that means in real terms\n\n00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.120\nis that he's accused of passing off payments to his lawyers as legal expenses when in fact\n\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.440\nthey were to reimburse him for hush money payments. They included $130,000 to Stormy\n\n00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.400\nDaniels to keep quiet about an alleged sexual encounter. Alvin Bragg is the Manhattan district\n\n00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.200\nattorney. It is a felony to falsify business records with intent to defraud and intent\n\n00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:39.040\nto conceal another crime. That is exactly what this case is about. 34 false statements\n\n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:48.160\nmade to cover up other crimes. No matter who you are, we cannot and will not normalise\n\n00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.840\nserious criminal conduct. Prosecutors are also accusing the former president of a broad\n\n00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.000\nso-called catch and kill scheme, whereby potentially damaging stories were bought up by friendly\n\n00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.920\npublications and then sat on. Apart from the money to Stormy Daniels, they also referenced\n\n00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.680\nmoney paid to a former Playboy model and to a Trump Tower doorman who threatened to publish\n\n00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.760\ninformation about an alleged love child fathered by Mr Trump. One of Mr Trump's lawyers, Joe\n\n00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.960\nTacopina, said the case should never have been brought. Today's unsealing of this indictment\n\n00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.320\nshows that the rule of law died in this country because while everyone is not above the law,\n\n00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.720\nno one's below it either. And if this man's name was not Donald J. Trump, there is no\n\n00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:39.040\nscenario we'd all be here today. Please understand that based on these charges. These are felony\n\n00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:45.200\ncharges Mr Trump is facing, the more serious level of criminal conduct in the US legal\n\n00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:52.000\nsystem. In theory, they could carry jail terms of up to four years. But the Trump team have\n\n00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.080\nvowed to fight the charges every step of the way, and the next few months could see a whole\n\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.840\nseries of motions challenging everything from the very basis of the case itself to where a\n\n00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:10.960\npossible trial should be held. Gary O'Donohue. The southwestern US state of Arizona has traditionally\n\n00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:17.280\nbeen seen as a Republican stronghold. But strong performances by the Democrats in recent years have\n\n00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.480\nchallenged that view. Our correspondent Sophie Long has been to its biggest city, Phoenix,\n\n00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.680\nto get reaction from Republican supporters. In presidential elections, Arizona is one of the\n\n00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:34.480\nmost contested and coveted states. It was once reliably Republican, but in 2020, it elected a\n\n00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.920\nDemocratic president for the first time in nearly quarter of a century. And last year, voters here\n\n00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.200\nchose a Democratic governor. The Republican candidate who won Donald Trump's endorsement\n\n00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.800\ndid not win the election. I've been a precinct committeeman in this precinct right here for 50\n\n00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.720\nyears. Alberto Gutierrez is a lifelong ultra conservative Republican. He voted for Donald\n\n00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:03.600\nTrump in 2016 and a bit more reluctantly in 2020. But even he's had enough. We need to change. We\n\n00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:12.000\nneed to find someone else, OK, down the road, others who are not as brash as Donald Trump,\n\n00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.040\nthat can carry and rebuild the Republican Party. I think he did a great job for this country.\n\n00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.080\nAlberto's wife, Miriam, disagrees. She thinks the indictment is politically motivated,\n\n00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.640\nand she wants to see Donald Trump back in the White House to support American businesses and\n\n00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:34.240\nstrong border control. She and Alberto emigrated the right way, they say, from Cuba to the United\n\n00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:42.160\nStates. Believe me, if Trump runs, either he votes for Trump or I will divorce him. How do you like?\n\n00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:48.720\nAfter 62 years? Yeah, after 62 years, I will say goodbye.\n\n00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.640\nThe many here, including at least two of Alberto and Miriam's five children,\n\n00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.680\nthink it's time to say goodbye to Donald Trump and bring in fresh candidates to unify the\n\n00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.800\nRepublican Party in Arizona and across the nation, regardless of whether Donald Trump\n\n00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:09.200\nis found guilty or not. Sophie Long. After Mr Trump addressed his supporters in Florida,\n\n00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.400\nI spoke to our correspondent, Michelle Fleury. I began by asking her what impact today's\n\n00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.280\ndevelopments might have on his chances of winning another presidential election.\n\n00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:27.360\nIt felt more like a campaign rally, quite frankly, than it did, you know, reflections on the day we\n\n00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:33.680\njust saw outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan. And this is someone who knows how to take advantage\n\n00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:39.120\nof situations. And I think that's what he's done from the moment we first saw the indictment.\n\n00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:45.120\nHe immediately kind of used it as a rallying cry to his base, to his supporters, to kind of\n\n00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.240\ncircle the wagons around him. He's used it to raise money, raising as much as $10 million\n\n00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.760\nsince the indictment dropped. So I think we know sort of what it does for him politically,\n\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:02.000\nright from the beginning, people have been saying you can't kind of separate this legal case from\n\n00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.680\nthe political implications. And I think we're seeing that in real time right now.\n\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.640\nYou mentioned the money there that he's been raising, donations have been flooding in. It's\n\n00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.760\ngoing to be really hard, I think, isn't it, for another candidate to match that kind of money?\n\n00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.120\nAnd it's been fascinating to watch the response from Republicans. Mitt Romney, one of those who\n\n00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.840\nhasn't always been a fan, quite frankly, of Donald Trump, was out today saying that, you know,\n\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.360\nhe was against this prosecution that has been brought by the district attorney here in New York,\n\n00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.160\nsaying he didn't think it was sort of appropriate. And I think you're seeing that from the rank and\n\n00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.280\nfile of the Republican Party. Right now, no one is speaking out against Donald Trump. In fact,\n\n00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.320\nthey're all backing him. And that is going to make it very challenging for any Republican\n\n00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:52.000\npresidential hopefuls for 2024. How do you go up against Donald Trump in that context?\n\n00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.720\nWhat is something to keep an eye on is obviously the next court appearance, that's late December.\n\n00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.800\nAnd that comes just a couple of weeks before we start to see those first votes in the Republican\n\n00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.080\nprimaries. And it seems maybe decades ago that this kind of thing would finish someone's\n\n00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.440\npolitical career, even if they were found not guilty. But so many people are flocking to him\n\n00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.320\nnow, it could almost have the opposite effect. But I mean, this was never a traditional\n\n00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.320\ncandidate from the very beginning. As you say, before Donald Trump, if anyone had had to go\n\n00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.640\nthrough something like the Access Hollywood tape that was revealed, that would have ended their\n\n00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.960\npolitical career. That hasn't been the case for this president. He's faced two impeachments,\n\n00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.240\nand now he faces a criminal case. And yet he's rising in the polls.\n\n00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.320\nThat was Michelle Flurry.\n\n00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.680\nAnd that's all from us for now. But there will be another regular edition of the Global News\n\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.680\nPodcast later. Remember, you can comment on this podcast by sending us an email.

The editor is Karen Martin.\n\n00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.760\nAnd I'm Charlotte Gallagher. Until next time, goodbye.\n\n00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.640\nIt's late night in London, and we're recording an emergency episode of AmeriCast with the news\n\n00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:24.080\nthat Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 charges. We're going to be talking about what\n\n00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.720\nthis means for Trump, for the Democrats and Republicans, and how it shifts the state of play\n\n00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:34.480\nfor the 2024 election. You can hear all of the analysis on AmeriCast. Just search for it wherever\n\n00:12:34.480 --> 00:13:01.360\nyou get your BBC podcasts.\n\n"
