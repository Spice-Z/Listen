It contains no runtime code.\n\nThe types in this package describe the API as of Gateway 0.35.0 (ie, with onSchemaLoadOrUpdate). It is extracted from the Apollo Server 3 `apollo-server-types` package. Most of the type names have been changed to start with `Gateway`, so that they coexist better with similarly-named types. (Because TypeScript is generally structurally typed, this is OK.)\n\nNote that the cache scope field (eg, on `requestContext.overallCachePolicy.scope`) is defined as `any` in this package. That's because in AS3 this type is an enum, and enums in TypeScript are _not_ structurally typed. So we can't actually create an object of this type without depending on AS3 (or updating AS3 to get its definition from somewhere shared).\n\nWe have updated `@apollo/gateway` (v0 and v2) to define its types from this package rather than `apollo-server-types`. This allows Gateway to be compatible with both AS3 and AS4 (and even AS2, for Gateway 0.x) without needing to pull either package's code into the TypeScript build.\n\nApollo Server 4 directly depends on this package and uses its types to construct its calls to the Gateway.",

It's the best way to build a production-ready, self-documenting GraphQL API that can use data from any source.\n\n\nYou can use Apollo Server as:\n\n* A stand-alone GraphQL server\n* The GraphQL server for a [subgraph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/subgraphs/) in a federated supergraph\n* The gateway for a [federated supergraph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/)\n\nApollo Server provides a simple API for integrating with any Node.js web framework or serverless environment. The `@apollo/server` package itself ships with a minimally-configurable, standalone web server which handles CORS and body parsing out of the box. Integrations with other environments are community-maintained.\n\nApollo Server provides:\n\n*  **Straightforward setup**, so your client developers can start fetching data quickly\n*  **Incremental adoption**, enabling you to add features as they're needed\n*  **Universal compatibility** with any data source, any build tool, and any GraphQL client\n*  **Production readiness**, enabling you to confidently run your graph in production\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull documentation for Apollo Server is available on [our documentation site](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/). This README shows the basics of getting a server running (both standalone and with Express), but most features are only documented on our docs site.\n\n\n## Getting started: standalone server\n\n> You can also check out the [getting started](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started) guide in the Apollo Server docs for more details, including examples in both TypeScript and JavaScript.\n\nApollo Server's standalone server lets you get a GraphQL server up and running quickly without needing to set up an HTTP server yourself. It allows all the same configuration of GraphQL logic as the Express integration, but does not provide the ability to make fine-grained tweaks to the HTTP-specific behavior of your server.\n\nFirst, install Apollo Server and the JavaScript implementation of the core GraphQL algorithms:\n\n```\nnpm install @apollo/server graphql\n```\n\nThen, write the following to `server.mjs`. (By using the `.mjs` extension, Node lets you use the `await` keyword at the top level.)\n\n```js\nimport { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';\nimport { startStandaloneServer } from '@apollo/server/standalone';\n\n// The GraphQL schema\nconst typeDefs = `#graphql\n  type Query {\n    hello: String\n  }\n`;\n\n// A map of functions which return data for the schema.\nconst resolvers = {\n  Query: {\n    hello: () => 'world',\n  },\n};\n\nconst server = new ApolloServer({\n  typeDefs,\n  resolvers,\n});\n\nconst { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server);\nconsole.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`);\n```\n\nNow run your server with:\n\n```\nnode server.mjs\n```\n\nOpen the URL it prints in a web browser. It will show [Apollo Sandbox](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/sandbox/), a web-based tool for running GraphQL operations. Try running the operation `query { hello }`!\n\n\n## Getting started: Express middleware\n\nApollo Server's built-in Express middleware lets you run your GraphQL server as part of an app built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/), the most popular web framework for Node.\n\nFirst, install Apollo Server, the JavaScript implementation of the core GraphQL algorithms, Express, and two common Express middleware packages:\n\n```\nnpm install @apollo/server graphql express cors body-parser\n```\n\nIf using Typescript you may also need to install additional type declaration packages as development dependencies to avoid common errors when importing the above packages (i.e. Could not find a declaration file for module '`cors`'):\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev @types/cors @types/express @types/body-parser\n```\n\nThen, write the following to `server.mjs`.

We strongly\n> encourage developers to contact Apollo support at `support@apollographql.com`\n> to discuss their use case prior to building their own reporting agent using\n> this module.\n\nThis module provides JavaScript/TypeScript\n[Protocol buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) definitions\nfor the Apollo usage reporting API.  These definitions are generated for\nconsumption from the `reports.proto` file which is defined internally within\nApollo.\n\n## Development\n\n> **Note:** Due to a dependency on Unix tools (e.g. `bash`, `grep`, etc.), the\n> development of this module requires a Unix system.  There is no reason why\n> this can't be avoided, the time just hasn't been taken to make those changes.\n> We'd happily accept a PR which makes the appropriate changes!\n\nCurrently, this package generates a majority of its code with\n`@apollo/protobufjs` (a fork of\n[`protobufjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protobufjs) that we maintain\nspecifically for this package) based on the `reports.proto` file. The output is\ngenerated with the `generate` npm script.\n\nThe root of the repository provides some `devDependencies` necessary to build\nthese definitions; these will be installed by running `npm install` at the root\nof this workspace. When making changes to this module, run scripts via `npm run\nSCRIPTNAME -w @apollo/usage-reporting-protobuf` in the **root** of this monorepo in\norder to update the definitions in _this_ module. The `-w` flag is shorthand for\n`--workspace`; this monorepo leverages NPM workspaces to manage its packages.\n\nTo update `reports.proto` to the current version recognized by the Studio usage\nreporting ingress, run `npm run update-proto -w\n@apollo/usage-reporting-protobuf`. To then regenerate the JS and TS files, run\n`npm run generate -w @apollo/usage-reporting-protobuf`. We check in the\ngenerated code and only regenerate it manually, partially to make builds faster\n(no need to run pbjs on every `npm install`) and partially so that we don't have\nto make sure that `pbjs` runs on every Node version that we support.",

The development server is the proxy between a native runtime (Expo Go, Dev Client) and a JS Bundler (Metro, Webpack).\n  - To accomplish secure manifest signing (think https/TSL/SSL for web (required for sandboxing AsyncStorage, Permissions, etc.)) we need an authenticated Expo user account. This is the only reason we include the authentication commands `login`, `logout`, `whoami`, `register`. Standard web CLIs don't have authentication commands because they either don't set up https or they use emulation via packages like `devcert`.\n- Orchestrating various native tools like Xcode, `Simulator.app`, Android Studio, ADB, etc. to make native builds as painless as possible. `run:ios`, `run:android` commands.\n- Implementing a versioned `prebuild` command that can reliably work with a project for long periods of time. Prebuild is like a bundler for native code, it generates the `ios`, `android` folders based on the project Expo config (`app.json`).\n  - `npx expo config` is auxiliary to `npx expo prebuild` and used for debugging/introspection.\n- Installing versioned libraries with `npx expo install` this is a minimal utility born out of pure necessity since versioning in React Native is hard to get right.\n\n# Contributing\n\nTo develop the CLI run (defaults to watch mode):\n\n```\nyarn build\n```\n\nWe highly recommend setting up an alias for the Expo CLI so you can try it in projects all around your computer. Open your `.zshrc` or other config file and add:\n\n```\nalias nexpo=\"/path/to/expo/packages/@expo/cli/build/bin/cli\"\n```\n\nThen use it with `nexpo` like `nexpo config`. You can also set up a debug version:\n\n```\nalias expo-inspect=\"node --inspect /path/to/expo/packages/@expo/cli/build/bin/cli\"\n```\n\nThen you can run it and visit `chrome://inspect/#devices` in Chrome, and press \"Open dedicated DevTools for Node\" to get a debugger attached to your process. When debugging the CLI, you'll want to disable workers whenever possible, this will make all code run on the same thread, this is mostly applicable to the `start` command, i.e. `expo-inspect start --max-workers 0`.\n\n## Format\n\n- Be sure to update the [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) with changes for every PR. You only need to add the message, our GitHub bot will automatically suggest adding your name and PR number to the diff.\n- End `async` functions with `Async` like `runAsync`. This is just how we format functions at Expo.\n- When throwing errors, always opt for `CommandError` instead of `Error` -- this helps with debugging and making the experience feel more coherent.\n- Utilize the unified `Log` module instead of `console.log`.\n- When logging with variables, utilize the following format `Something happened (foo: bar, baz: foz)`.\n  - Avoid other formats like `Something happened: bar, foz` or `Something happened: foo=bar, baz=foz`.\n- Main UI components like command names (`expo start`), arguments (`--port`), and `--help` messages should be modified internally, by the Expo team to ensure the developer experience is unified across Expo tooling. External contributions modifying these core aspects may be rejected.\n- Use the `profile` utility method with the `EXPO_PROFILE=1` environment variable to measure execution time.\n- Avoid globals and singletons as these make testing harder and less predictable. The only global we have (at the time of writing this) is the `isOffline` boolean.\n\n## Environment\n\n- Always be cautious of the transitive size of dependencies. [packagephobia](https://packagephobia.now.sh/) is a great resource for determining if a package is lean. Try to minimize adding dependencies to the CLI.\n- We build the CLI using `taskr` + `swc`, this is partially inspired by Next.js' local CLI.\n- The build pipeline will inline the CLI version as an environment variable that is accessible anywhere in the CLI codebase. You can access it via `process.env.__EXPO_VERSION` instead of reading the local `package.json` at runtime.\n- Unlike the legacy global Expo CLI, this CLI is shipped with `expo` meaning the SDK Version is always present.\n  - Reduce SDK specific tasks since only one SDK should be accounted for in a single version of `@expo/cli`.\n  - The `@expo/config` method `getConfig` does not need the `skipSDKVersionRequirement` in any case since `expo` should always be installed. Ex: `getConfig('...', { skipSDKVersionRequirement: true });` shouldn't be used.\n- Also unlike the global Expo CLI we can assume that node modules are always installed since this CLI should be used via a project's local `node_modules` folder.\n  - This means we can't perform operations that upgrade the `expo` package as these may kill the running process. Features that need this pattern (like `expo upgrade`) should live in standalone global tools.\n\n## Testing\n\nThere are two testing scripts:\n\n- `yarn test`: Controlled unit and integration tests.\n- `yarn test:e2e`: End to end testing for CLI commands. This requires the files to be built with `yarn build`\n\n---\n\n- You can target a specific set of tests with the `--watch` flag. Example: `yarn test --watch config`.\n- We use backticks for `it` blocks. Example <code>it(`works`)</code>.\n- If a pull request is fully self-contained to the `packages/@expo/cli/` folder (i.e. no `yarn.lock` modifications, etc.) then most native CI tests will be skipped, making CI pass faster in PRs.\n\n### Unit Testing Guidelines\n\n- Use `nock` for network requests.\n- No top level `describe` blocks that wrap all the tests in a file.\n- When testing a function, pass the function to the `describe` block instead of a stringified function name:\n  - `describe(foobar, () => {})` instead of `describe('foobar', () => {})`\n- Use virtual `fs` via `memfs` whenever possible.\n- We have a lot of global module [**mocks**](./e2e/setup.ts) already in place, consider them when writing tests.\n- GitHub Copilot can make writing tests a little less tedious.\n\n### E2E Testing Guidelines\n\n- E2E tests should be resilient and reliable, be sure to give them plenty of time for network requests.\n- When testing locally you should attempt to reuse node modules for faster results. In the `npx expo prebuild` and `npx expo start` commands for instance, we utilize a helper method that will default to reusing a project + node_modules when run locally. This can be [toggled off](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/11a5a4d27b7e1c8e4d6ddf0401397d789d89f52a/packages/%40expo/cli/e2e/__tests__/utils.ts#L174) to bootstrap a fresh project every time.\n- When bootstrapping test projects, utilize the temporary folder `os.tmpdir()` as this folder is automatically cleaned up when the computer restarts.\n\n## Coming from Expo CLI\n\n> TL;DR: `expo-cli` was 'make it work', whereas `@expo/cli` is 'make it right, make it fast'.\n\nThe legacy global `expo-cli` package was deprecated in favor of this versioned `@expo/cli` package for the following reasons:\n\n- `expo-cli` was too big and took way too long to install. This made CI frustrating to set up since you needed to also target global node modules for caching.\n- `expo-cli` worked for almost all versions of the `expo` package, meaning it was getting more complex with every release.\n- `expo-cli` combined service commands (like the legacy `build`, `submit`, `publish`) with project-level commands like `expo start`. We've since divided services into `eas-cli` and project commands into `npx expo` (`@expo/cli`). This structure is more optimal/faster for developers since they can install/update commands when they need them.\n- This CLI utilizes more Node.js standard features like `$EDITOR` instead of the custom `$EXPO_EDITOR` environment variable. Also transitioning away from `$EXPO_DEBUG` and more towards `$DEBUG=expo:*`. These types of changes make Expo CLI play nicer with existing tooling.\n- The DevTools UI has been deprecated to reduce the net install size, minimize complexity, and make room for future debugging UIs (Hermes/v8 Chrome debugger).\n- The `expo start:web` and `expo web` commands have been rolled into `npx expo start` as we now lazily load platforms until the device requests them.\n- Other missing or beta features from `expo-cli` may still be getting migrated over to this new CLI.

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# expo/devcert\n\nA fork of `devcert` with bundle size optimizations.\n\n# devcert - Development SSL made easy\n\nSo, running a local HTTPS server usually sucks. There's a range of\napproaches, each with their own tradeoff. The common one, using self-signed\ncertificates, means having to ignore scary browser warnings for each project.\n\ndevcert makes the process easy. Want a private key and certificate file to\nuse with your server? Just ask:\n\n```js\nlet ssl = await devcert.certificateFor(\"my-app.test\");\nhttps.createServer(ssl, app).listen(3000);\n```\n\nNow open https://my-app.test:3000 and voila - your page loads with no scary\nwarnings or hoops to jump through.\n\n> Certificates are cached by name, so two calls for\n> `certificateFor('foo')` will return the same key and certificate.\n\n## Options\n\nWhen it installs or upgrades, devcert creates a self-signed certificate\nauthority (CA) which it uses to sign all certificates it creates. It will try\nto register this CA with OS keychains in OSX, Linux, and Windows. However,\nsome HTTP clients (such as Firefox and NodeJS itself) use their own trusted\ncertificate list instead of the operating system's keychain. The `getCaPath`\nand `getCaBuffer` options make the CA available in the `certificateFor()`\nreturn object itself, so that these programs can choose whether to trust it.\n\n### getCaPath\n\nSet this option to `true` and the returned object will inlude a `caPath`\nproperty, set to the file path of the certificate authority file. Use this\npath to add the certificate to local trust stores which accept paths as\narguments, such as NodeJS's builtin environment variable\n`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`..\n\n### getCaBuffer\n\nSet this option to `true` and the returned object will inlude a `ca`\nproperty, set to the UTF-8-encoded contents of the certificate authority\nfile. Use this path to add the certificate to local trust stores which don't\nuse OS settings, lke the examples mentioned above.\n\n### skipHostsFile\n\nIf you supply a custom domain name (i.e. any domain other than `localhost`)\nwhen requesting a certificate from devcert, it will attempt to modify your\nsystem to redirect requests for that domain to your local machine (rather\nthan to the real domain). It does this by modifying your `/etc/hosts` file.\n\nIf you pass in the `skipHostsFile` option, devcert will skip this step. This\nmeans that if you ask for certificates for `my-app.test` (for example), and\ndon't have some other DNS redirect method in place, that you won't be able to\naccess your app at `https://my-app.test` because your computer wouldn't know\nthat `my-app.test` should resolve your local machine.\n\nKeep in mind that SSL certificates are issued for _domains_, so if you ask\nfor a certificate for `my-app.test`, and don't have any kind of DNS redirect\nin place (`/etc/hosts` or otherwise), trying to hit `localhost` won't work,\neven if the app you intended to serve via `my-app.test` is running on your\nlocal machine (since the SSL certificate won't say `localhost`).\n\n### skipCertutil\n\nThis option will tell devcert to avoid installing `certutil` tooling.\n\n`certutil` is a tooling package used to automated the installation of SSL\ncertificates in certain circumstances; specifically, Firefox (for every OS)\nand Chrome (on Linux only).\n\nNormally, devcert will attempt to install `certutil` if it's need and not\nalready present on your system. If don't want devcert to install this\npackage, pass `skipCertutil: true`.\n\nIf you decide to `skipCertutil`, the initial setup process for devcert\nchanges in these two scenarios:\n\n- **Firefox on all platforms**: Thankully, Firefox makes this easy. There's a\n  point-and-click wizard for importing and trusting a certificate, so if you\n  specify `skipCertutil: true`, devcert will instead automatically open Firefox\n  and kick off this wizard for you. Simply follow the prompts to trust the\n  certificate. **Reminder: you'll only need to do this once per machine**\n\n- **Chrome on Linux**: Unfortunately, it appears that the **only** way to get\n  Chrome to trust an SSL certificate on Linux is via the `certutil` tooling -\n  there is no manual process for it. Thus, if you are using Chrome on Linux, do\n  **not** supply `skipCertuil: true`. If you do, devcert certificates will not\n  be trusted by Chrome.\n\nThe `certutil` tooling is installed in OS-specific ways:\n\n- Mac: `brew install nss`\n- Linux: `apt install libnss3-tools`\n- Windows: N/A (there is no easy, hands-off way to install certutil on Windows,\n  so devcert will simply fallback to the wizard approach for Firefox outlined\n  above)\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen you ask for a development certificate, devcert will first check to see\nif it has run on this machine before. If not, it will create a root\ncertificate authority and add it to your OS and various browser trust stores.\nYou'll likely see password prompts from your OS at this point to authorize\nthe new root CA.\n\nSince your machine now trusts this root CA, it will trust any certificates\nsigned by it. So when you ask for a certificate for a new domain, devcert\nwill use the root CA credentials to generate a certificate specific to the\ndomain you requested, and returns the new certificate to you.\n\nIf you request a domain that has already had certificates generated for it,\ndevcert will simply return the cached certificates.\n\nThis setup ensures that browsers won't show scary warnings about untrusted\ncertificates, since your OS and browsers will now trust devcert's\ncertificates.\n\n## Security Concerns\n\nThere's a reason that your OS prompts you for your root password when devcert\nattempts to install it's root certificate authority. By adding it to your\nmachine's trust stores, your browsers will automatically trust _any_ certificate\ngenerated with it.\n\nThis exposes a potential attack vector on your local machine: if someone else\ncould use the devcert certificate authority to generate certificates, and if\nthey could intercept / manipulate your network traffic, they could theoretically\nimpersonate some websites, and your browser would not show any warnings (because\nit trusts the devcert authority).\n\nTo prevent this, devcert takes steps to ensure that no one can access the\ndevcert certificate authority credentials to generate malicious certificates\nwithout you knowing. The exact approach varies by platform:\n\n- **macOS and Linux**: the certificate authority's credentials are written to files that are only readable by the root user (i.e. `chown 0 ca-cert.crt` and\n  `chmod 600 ca-cert.crt`). When devcert itself needs these, it shells out to\n  `sudo` invocations to read / write the credentials.\n- **Windows**: because of my unfamiliarity with Windows file permissions, I\n  wasn't confident I would be able to correctly set permissions to mimic the setup\n  on macOS and Linux. So instead, devcert will prompt you for a password, and then\n  use that to encrypt the credentials with an AES256 cipher. The password is never\n  written to disk.\n\nTo further protect these credentials, any time they are written to disk, they\nare written to temporary files, and are immediately deleted after they are no longer needed.\n\nAdditionally, the root CA certificate is unique to your machine only: it's\ngenerated on-the-fly when it is first installed. ensuring there are no\ncentral / shared keys to crack across machines.\n\n### Why install a root certificate authority at all?\n\nThe root certificate authority makes it simpler to manage which domains are\nconfigured for SSL by devcert. The alternative is to generate and trust\nself-signed certificates for each domain. The problem is that while devcert\nis able to add a certificate to your machine's trust stores, the tooling to\nremove a certificate doesn't cover every case. So if you ever wanted to\n_untrust_ devcert's certificates, you'd have to manually remove each one from\neach trust store.\n\nBy trusting only a single root CA, devcert is able to guarantee that when you\nwant to _disable_ SSL for a domain, it can do so with no manual intervention\n\n- we just delete the domain-specific certificate files. Since these\n  domain-specific files aren't installed in your trust stores, once they are\n  gone, they are gone.\n\n## Integration\n\ndevcert has been designed from day one to work as low-level library that other\ntools can delegate to. The goal is to make HTTPS development easy for everyone,\nregardless of framework or library choice.\n\nWith that in mind, if you'd like to use devcert in your library/framework/CLI,\ndevcert makes that easy.\n\nIn addition to the options above, devcert exposes a `ui` option. This option\nallows you to control all the points where devcert requries user interaction,\nsubstituting your own prompts and user interface. You can use this to brand\nthe experience with your own tool's name, localize the messages, or integrate\ndevcert into a larger existing workflow.\n\nThe `ui` option should be an object with the following methods:\n\n```ts\n{\n  async getWindowsEncryptionPassword(): Promise<string> {\n    // Invoked when devcert needs the password used to encrypt the root\n    // certificate authority credentials on Windows. May be invoked multiple\n    // times if the user's supplied password is incorrect\n  },\n  async warnChromeOnLinuxWithoutCertutil(): Promise<string> {\n    // Invoked when devcert is run on Linux, detects that Chrome is installed,\n    // and the `skipCertutil` option is `true`. Used to warn the user that\n    // Chrome will not work with `skipCertutil: true` on Linux.\n  },\n  async closeFirefoxBeforeContinuing() {\n    // Invoked when devcert detects that Firefox is running while it is trying\n    // to programmatically install it's certificate authority in the Firefox\n    // trust store. Firefox appears to overwrite changes to the trust store on\n    // exit, so Firefox must be closed before devcert can continue. devcert will\n    // wait for Firefox to exit - this is just to prompt the user that they\n    // need to close the application.\n  },\n  async startFirefoxWizard(certificateHost: string) {\n    // Invoked when devcert detects a Firefox installation and `skipCertutil:\n    // true` was specified. This is invoked right before devcert launches the\n    // Firefox certificate import wizard GUI. Used to give the user a heads up\n    // as to why they are about to see Firefox pop up.\n    //\n    // The certificateHost provided is the URL for the temporary server that\n    // devcert has spun up in order to trigger the wizard(Firefox needs try to\n    // \"download\" the cert to trigger the wizard). This URL will load the page\n    // supplied in the `firefoxWizardPromptPage()` method below.\n    //\n    // Normally, devcert will automatically open this URL, but in case it fails\n    // you may want to print it out to the console with an explanatory message\n    // so the user isn't left hanging wondering what's happening.\n  },\n  async firefoxWizardPromptPage(certificateURL: string): Promise<string> {\n    // When devcert starts the Firefox certificate installation wizard GUI, it\n    // first loads an HTML page in Firefox. The template used for that page is\n    // the return value of this method. The supplied certificateURL is the path\n    // to the actual certificate. The Firefox tab must attempt to load this URL\n    // to trigger the wizard.\n    //\n    // The default implemenation is a simple redirect to that URL. But you could\n    // supply your own branded template here, with a button that says \"Install\n    // certificate\" that is linked to the certificateURL, along with a more in\n    // depth explanation of what is happening for example.\n  }\n  async waitForFirefoxWizard() {\n    // Invoked _after_ the Firefox certificate import wizard is kicked off. This\n    // method should not resolve until the user indicates that the wizard is\n    // complete (unfortunately, we have no way of determining that\n    // programmatically)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can supply any or all of these methods - ones you do not supply will fall\nback to the default implemenation.\n\n## Testing\n\nTesting a tool like devcert can be a pain. I haven't found a good automated\nsolution for cross platform GUI testing (the GUI part is necessary to test\neach browser's handling of devcert certificates, as well as test the Firefox\nwizard flow).\n\nTo make things easier, devcert comes with a series of virtual machine images. Each one is a snapshot taken right before running a test - just launch the machine and hit <Enter>.\n\nYou can also use the snapshotted state of the VMs to roll them back to a\npristine state for another round of testing.\n\n> **Note**: Be aware that the macOS license terms prohibit running it on\n> non-Apple hardware, so you must own a Mac to test that platform. If you don't\n> own a Mac - that's okay, just mention in the PR that you were unable to test\n> on a Mac and we're happy to test it for you.\n\n### Virtual Machine Snapshots\n\n- [macOS](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/devcert-test-snapshots/macOS.pvm.zip)\n- [Windows](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/devcert-test-snapshots/MSEdge+-+Win10.zip)\n- [Ubuntu](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/devcert-test-snapshots/Ubuntu+Linux.zip)\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Dave Wasmer](http://davewasmer.com)",

Once they take that action, the log should go away.\n- `warn`: Use when a product feature may stop functioning correctly; unexpected\n  scenario.\n- `error`: Only use when user App would stop functioning correctly - super rare!\n\n## Log Format\n\nEach log will be formatted in the following manner:\n\n```typescript\n`[${new Date()}]  ${COMPONENT_NAME}: ${...args}`\n```",

It shouldn't effect any runtime since we just remove dead or unused areas.\n\nYou can modify the list of optimizers this way:\n\n```ts\nimport { optimizeDocumentNode, removeDescriptions } from '@graphql-tools/optimize';\n\nconst myDocument: DocumentNode = { ... }\nconst optimizedDocument = optimizeDocumentNode(myDocument, [removeDescriptions]);\n```\n\n### Writing your own optimizer\n\nYou can create your own optimizer to manipulate `DocumentNode`, the API signature is pretty simple:\n\n```ts\nexport type DocumentOptimizer = (input: DocumentNode) => DocumentNode\n```\n\nTake a look at [./optimizers](this directory for inspiration and implementation reference).",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

See `StyleSheet.js` and `ViewStylePropTypes.js` for more info. | View.style | No | |\n| `disabled`| If true the user won't be able to move the slider.<br/>Default value is false. | bool | No | |\n| `maximumValue` | Initial maximum value of the slider.<br/>Default value is 1. | number | No | |\n| `minimumTrackTintColor` | The color used for the track to the left of the button.<br/>Overrides the default blue gradient image on iOS. | [color](https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors) | No | |\n| `minimumValue` | Initial minimum value of the slider.<br/>Default value is 0. | number | No | |\n| `lowerLimit` | Slide lower limit. The user won't be able to slide below this limit. | number | No | Android, iOS |\n| `upperLimit` | Slide upper limit. The user won't be able to slide above this limit. | number | No | Android, iOS |\n| `onSlidingStart` | Callback that is called when the user picks up the slider.<br/>The initial value is passed as an argument to the callback handler. | function | No | |\n| `onSlidingComplete` | Callback that is called when the user releases the slider, regardless if the value has changed.<br/>The current value is passed as an argument to the callback handler. | function | No | |\n| `onValueChange` | Callback continuously called while the user is dragging the slider. | function | No | |\n| `step` | Step value of the slider. The value should be between 0 and (maximumValue - minimumValue). Default value is 0.<br/>On Windows OS the default value is 1% of slider's range (from `minimumValue` to `maximumValue`). | number | No | |\n| `maximumTrackTintColor` | The color used for the track to the right of the button.<br/>Overrides the default gray gradient image on iOS. | [color](https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors) | No | |\n| `testID` | Used to locate this view in UI automation tests. | string | No | |\n| `value` | Write-only property representing the value of the slider. Can be used to programmatically control the position of the thumb. Entered once at the beginning still acts as an initial value. Changing the value programmatically does not trigger any event.<br/>The value should be between minimumValue and maximumValue, which default to 0 and 1 respectively. Default value is 0.<br/>_This is not a controlled component_, you don't need to update the value during dragging. | number | No | |\n| `tapToSeek` | Permits tapping on the slider track to set the thumb position.<br/>Defaults to false on iOS. No effect on Android or Windows. | bool | No | iOS |\n| `inverted` | Reverses the direction of the slider.<br/>Default value is false. | bool | No | |\n| `vertical` | Changes the orientation of the slider to vertical, if set to `true`.<br/>Default value is false. | bool | No | Windows |\n| `thumbTintColor` | Color of the foreground switch grip.<br/>**NOTE:** This prop will override the `thumbImage` prop set, meaning that if both `thumbImage` and `thumbTintColor` will be set, image used for the thumb may not be displayed correctly! | [color](https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors) | No | Android |\n| `maximumTrackImage` | Assigns a maximum track image. Only static images are supported. The leftmost pixel of the image will be stretched to fill the track. | Image<br/>.propTypes<br/>.source | No | iOS |\n| `minimumTrackImage` | Assigns a minimum track image. Only static images are supported. The rightmost pixel of the image will be stretched to fill the track. | Image<br/>.propTypes<br/>.source | No | iOS |\n| `thumbImage` | Sets an image for the thumb. Only static images are supported. Needs to be a URI of a local or network image; base64-encoded SVG is not supported. | Image<br/>.propTypes<br/>.source | No | |\n| `trackImage` | Assigns a single image for the track.

Run the following to verify:\n```sh\ncd package/\nnpm run lint\nnpm run test\n```\n\n* Remember to cover your changes with tests if possible.\n\nWhen [creating an issue](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-slider/issues/new/choose) please remember to specify the platform which the issue occurs on.\n\n## Running the example app \nWhile developing, you can run the example app to test your changes.\n\n### Setup\n\n- Clone the repository\n- Run `npm install` in the root directory to install dependencies.\n- Run `npm run example-<platform>`, where platform can be: `ios`, `android`, `windows`\n\nYou can also do this manually by:\n- Installing node modules for example app\n- Installing pods for iOS app\n- Running example app like always: `npx react-native run-<platform>`\n\n### New architecture setup (Fabric)\n\nIn order to use the new architecture some extra steps are needed. \n#### iOS \n- Install pods with new arch flag inside `example/ios` folder: `RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 pod install`\n- Run `npm run example-ios`\n\n#### Android \n- Set `newArchEnabled` to true inside `example/android/gradle.properties`\n- Run `npm run example-android`\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nIf you are using React Native version lower than 0.70, you need to setup manual linking for Android to work.\n</summary>\n\nInside `example/android/app/src/main/jni/Android.mk` add these lines: \n\n```diff\n+ include $(NODE_MODULES_DIR)/@react-native-community/slider/android/build/generated/source/codegen/jni/Android.mk\ninclude $(CLEAR_VARS)\n```\n\n```diff\n    libreact_codegen_rncore \\\n+   libreact_codegen_ReactSlider \\\n    libreact_debug \\\n```\n\nInside `example/android/app/src/main/jni/MainComponentsRegistry.cpp` update these lines: \n\n```diff\n#include <react/renderer/components/rncore/ComponentDescriptors.h>\n+ #include <react/renderer/components/ReactSlider/ComponentDescriptors.h>\n\n...\n\nMainComponentsRegistry::sharedProviderRegistry() {\n  auto providerRegistry = CoreComponentsRegistry::sharedProviderRegistry();\n\n  // Custom Fabric Components go here. You can register custom\n  // components coming from your App or from 3rd party libraries here.\n  //\n  // providerRegistry->add(concreteComponentDescriptorProvider<\n  //        AocViewerComponentDescriptor>());\n+ providerRegistry->add(concreteComponentDescriptorProvider<RNCSliderComponentDescriptor>());\n\n  return providerRegistry;\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- [Michał Chudziak](https://github.com/michalchudziak) - [Callstack](https://callstack.com/)\n- [Bartosz Klonowski](https://github.com/BartoszKlonowski) - [Callstack](https://callstack.com/)\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis module was extracted from `react-native` core.

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# Repeater.js\nThe missing constructor for creating safe async iterators.\n\nFor more information, visit [repeater.js.org](https://repeater.js.org).\n\n## Installation\n\nRepeater.js is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@repeaterjs/repeater) in the CommonJS and ESModule formats.\n\n`$ npm install @repeaterjs/repeater`\n\n`$ yarn add @repeaterjs/repeater`\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe core `@repeaterjs/repeater` module has no dependencies, but requires the following globals in order to work:\n- `Promise`\n- `WeakMap`\n- `Symbol`\n  - `Symbol.iterator`\n  - `Symbol.asyncIterator`\n\nIn addition, repeaters are most useful when used via `async/await` and `for await…of` syntax. You can transpile your code with babel or typescript to support enviroments which lack these features.\n\n## Examples\n\n<h4 id=\"timestamps\">Logging timestamps with setInterval</h4>\n\n```js\nimport { Repeater } from \"@repeaterjs/repeater\";\n\nconst timestamps = new Repeater(async (push, stop) => {\n  push(Date.now());\n  const interval = setInterval(() => push(Date.now()), 1000);\n  await stop;\n  clearInterval(interval);\n});\n\n(async function() {\n  let i = 0;\n  for await (const timestamp of timestamps) {\n    console.log(timestamp);\n    i++;\n    if (i >= 10) {\n      console.log(\"ALL DONE!\");\n      break; // triggers clearInterval above\n    }\n  }\n})();\n```\n\n<h4 id=\"websocket\">Creating a repeater from a websocket</h4>\n\n```js\nimport { Repeater } from \"@repeaterjs/repeater\";\n\nconst socket = new WebSocket(\"ws://echo.websocket.org\");\nconst messages = new Repeater(async (push, stop) => {\n  socket.onmessage = (ev) => push(ev.data);\n  socket.onerror = () => stop(new Error(\"WebSocket error\"));\n  socket.onclose = () => stop();\n  await stop;\n  socket.close();\n});\n\n(async function() {\n  for await (const message of messages) {\n    console.log(message);\n    if (message === \"close\") {\n      console.log(\"Closing!\");\n      break; // closes the socket\n    }\n  }\n})();\n\nsocket.onopen = () => {\n  socket.send(\"hello\"); // \"hello\"\n  socket.send(\"world\"); // \"world\"\n  socket.send(\"close\"); // \"close\", \"Closing!\"\n};\n```\n\n<h4 id=\"konami-code\">Listening for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code\">Konami Code</a> and canceling if <kbd>Escape</kbd> is pressed</h4>\n\n```js\nimport { Repeater } from \"@repeaterjs/repeater\";\n\nconst keys = new Repeater(async (push, stop) => {\n  const listener = (ev) => {\n    if (ev.key === \"Escape\") {\n      stop();\n    } else {\n      push(ev.key);\n    }\n  };\n  window.addEventListener(\"keyup\", listener);\n  await stop;\n  window.removeEventListener(\"keyup\", listener);\n});\n\nconst konami = [\"ArrowUp\", \"ArrowUp\", \"ArrowDown\", \"ArrowDown\", \"ArrowLeft\", \"ArrowRight\", \"ArrowLeft\", \"ArrowRight\", \"b\", \"a\"];\n\n(async function() {\n  let i = 0;\n  for await (const key of keys) {\n    if (key === konami[i]) {\n      i++;\n    } else {\n      i = 0;\n    }\n    if (i >= konami.length) {\n      console.log(\"KONAMI!!!\");\n      break; // removes the keyup listener\n    }\n  }\n})();\n```\n\n<h4 id=\"observables\">Converting an observable to an async iterator</h4>\n\n```js\nimport { Subject } from \"rxjs\";\nimport { Repeater } from \"@repeaterjs/repeater\";\n\nconst observable = new Subject();\nconst repeater = new Repeater(async (push, stop) => {\n  const subscription = observable.subscribe({\n    next: (value) => push(value),\n    error: (err) => stop(err),\n    complete: () => stop(),\n  });\n  await stop;\n  subscription.unsubscribe();\n});\n\n(async function() {\n  try {\n    for await (const value of repeater) {\n      console.log(\"Value: \", value);\n    }\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.log(\"Error caught: \", err);\n  }\n})();\nobservable.next(1);\n// Value: 1\nobservable.next(2);\n// Value: 2\nobservable.error(new Error(\"Hello from observable\"));\n// Error caught: Error: Hello from observable\n```",

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# `@whatwg-node/fetch`\n\nA ponyfill package for the [Fetch Standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/). If your JavaScript\nenvironment doesn't implement this standard natively, this package automatically ponyfills the\nmissing parts, and export them as a module; otherwise it exports the native ones without touching\nthe environment's internals. It also exports some additional standard APIs that are required by the\nFetch Standard.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nyarn add @whatwg-node/fetch\n```\n\n## Why Fetch API and why this ponyfill in general?\n\nIf you are building a JavaScript library, and you want it to support all JavaScript environments not\nonly Node.js. Fetch API is the best choice for you. Because it's a standard, and it's implemented by\nthe most environments out there expect Node.js :). So you can use Fetch API in your library, and\nyour users can use it in their browsers, Deno, Bun, Cloudflare Works, and in Node.js.\n\n> This is how we support all JavaScript environments in\n> [GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/docs/integrations/z-other-environments).\n> In GraphQL Yoga, we don't care which JavaScript environment you prefer, we support all of them.\n\n## Why we should still use these for Node.js even if it already implements them natively\n\nEven if newer Node.js already implements Fetch API and Data Text Encoding API natively, we still\nrecommend to use this package, because this package implements them for Node.js in more efficient\nway.\n\n- [See problems with the global fetch/undici in Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/1203)\n- - We offer a patched version of `node-fetch` that doesn't use `undici` and Node.js streams\n    internally, so it's more efficient than the native one.\n- [See problems with text encoding API in Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/39879)\n- - We use [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) instead of the native one, because\n    `Buffer` is faster than the native one unfortunately.\n- `Body.formData()` is not implemented by Node.js, so we implement it with `busboy` internally. So\n  you can consume incoming multipart(file uploads) requests with `.formData` in Node.js.\n\n### Handling file uploads with Fetch API\n\n```ts\nimport { Request } from '@whatwg-node/fetch'\n\n// See how you can handle file uploads with Fetch API\nhttp.createServer(async (req, res) => {\n  const request = new Request(req)\n  const formData = await request.formData()\n  const file = formData.get('file')\n  // ...\n})\n```\n\n> If you want to limit the size of the multipart form data, you can use `createFetch`. See the\n> [API](#api) section for more details.\n\n## API\n\nThe following are exported by this package:\n\n### WHATWG Fetch Standard\n\n- [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch)\n- [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)\n- [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response)\n- [Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers)\n- [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData)\n- [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController)\n\n### Web Streams API\n\n- [ReadableStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream)\n- [WritableStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WritableStream)\n- [TransformStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransformStream)\n\n### URL Standard\n\n- [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL)\n- [URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams)\n- [URLPattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLPattern)\n\n### Data Types\n\n- [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob)\n- [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)\n\n### Data Encoding/Decoding API\n\n- [TextEncoder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder)\n- [TextDecoder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextDecoder)\n- [btoa](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/btoa)\n\n### Web Crypto API\n\n- [crypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)\n\n### Create variations of the implementation\n\n- `createFetch`\n\n`createFetch` allows you to create an API with some specific flags that are not available in the\nactual API.\n\n#### Limit the multipart form data size\n\nThis is useful if you parse the multipart request bodies with `.formData()`.\n\n```ts\nimport { createFetch } from '@whatwg-node/fetch'\n\nconst fetchAPI = createFetch({\n  formDataLimits: {\n    // Maximum allowed file size (in bytes)\n    fileSize: 1000000,\n    // Maximum allowed number of files\n    files: 10,\n    // Maximum allowed size of content (operations, variables etc...)\n    fieldSize: 1000000,\n    // Maximum allowed header size for form data\n    headerSize: 1000000\n  }\n})\n\n// See how you can handle file uploads with Fetch API\nhttp.createServer(async (req, res) => {\n  const request = new Request(req)\n  const formData = await request.formData()\n  const file = formData.get('file')\n  // ...\n})\n```",

That is, you pass it an async\ncallback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the\ngiven callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install agent-base\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server\nfor every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net');\nvar tls = require('tls');\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar agent = require('agent-base');\n\nvar endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// This is the important part!\nparsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {\n  var socket;\n  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module\n  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n    socket = tls.connect(opts);\n  } else {\n    socket = net.connect(opts);\n  }\n  return socket;\n});\n\n// Everything else works just like normal...\nhttp.get(parsed, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nReturning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:\n\n```js\nagent(async function (req, opts) {\n  await sleep(1000);\n  // etc…\n});\n```\n\nReturn another `http.Agent` instance to \"pass through\" the responsibility\nfor that HTTP request to that agent:\n\n```js\nagent(function (req, opts) {\n  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]\n\nCreates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`\nfor every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function\nis responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be\nused as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.\n\nThe `options` object accepts the following properties:\n\n  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).\n\nThe callback function should have the following signature:\n\n### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined\n\nThe ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and\nand the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed\nto the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted\nto be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however\nelse you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to\nthe callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will\ncontinue to proceed.\n\nIf the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the\n`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent",

It will either trim the results or add necessary amount of spaces. The `bias` control if trimming/padding should be done at the start of the string representing built children or at the end.\n\n```js\nfixed(5, 'start', 'ERR'); // => '  ERR'\nfixed(8, 'end', color('green', 'success')); // equals to color('green', 'success') + ' '\nfixed(10, 'end', 'Hello', pad(2), 'World') // => 'Hello  Wor'\n```\n\n#### `ifElse`\n\n```ts\nifElse(\n  condition: Condition,\n  ifTrueFragment: string | IFragment,\n  elseFragment: string | IFragment\n): IFragment\n\ntype ConditionValue = boolean | string | number | null | undefined;\ntype Condition = ConditionValue | (() => ConditionValue);\n```\n\nChange the output based on condition. Condition can ba a primitive value, which can be casted to boolean or a function. If conation or return value of condition is evaluated to `true`, the first argument - `ifTrueFragment` will be used, otherwise `elseFragment`.\n\n```js\nlet condition = getConditionValue()\nifElse(\n  () => condition,\n  color('red', 'ERROR'),\n  color('yellow', 'WARNING')\n)\n```\n\n#### `provide`\n\n```ts\nprovide<T>(\n  value: T,\n  builder: (value: T) => string | IFragment\n): IFragment\n```\n\nProvides given value to a builder function, which should return `string` or fragment. Useful in situations when the output is connected with some calculated value - using `provide` you only need to calculate final value once and forward it to custom styling logic.\n\n```js\nprovide(getMessageFromSomewhere(), value => {\n  switch (value.level) {\n    case 'error':\n      return container(\n        color('red', modifier('bold', value.level.toUpperCase())),\n        pad(2),\n        value.log\n      );\n    case 'info':\n      return container(\n        color('blue', value.level.toUpperCase()),\n        pad(2),\n        value.log\n      );\n    default:\n      return container(value.level.toUpperCase(), pad(2), value.log);\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n<!-- badges (common) -->\n\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/l/ansi-fragments.svg?style=flat-square\n[license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[prs-welcome-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square\n[prs-welcome]: http://makeapullrequest.com\n[coc-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20of-conduct-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square\n[coc]: https://github.com/zamotany/ansi-fragments/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n[chat-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-discord-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square&colorB=7289DA&logo=discord\n[chat]: https://discord.gg/zwR2Cdh\n\n[version]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ansi-fragments.svg?style=flat-square\n[package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-fragments",

    "licenseText": "A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# ast-types-flow\n\nFlow types for the Javascript AST. Based off of [benjamn/ast-types](https://github.com/benjamn/ast-types).\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst install `ast-types-flow` via npm, then you can import any of the types\nthat are exported.\n\n```javascript\n/* @flow */\n\nimport type {Node} from 'ast-types-flow';\n\nfunction getName(node: Node): string {\n  switch (node.type) {\n    case 'Identifier':\n      return node.name;\n\n    case 'ClassDeclaration':\n      return node.id.name; // Error, id could be null.\n\n    case 'FunctionDeclaration':\n      return node.id.name; // Fine if it's always there.\n\n    case 'FunctionExpression':\n      if (node.id) {\n        return node.id.name; // Can refine id to make sure it exists.\n      } else {\n        return 'Unknown';\n      }\n\n    case 'Literal':\n      return node.name; // Error, Literals don't have names, don't be silly.\n  }\n  return 'Unknown';\n}\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nA notion of \"extends\" is added to the Flow syntax via comments. A transform is\nincluded that will compile the source code into useful disjoint union types\nbased on how the different types extend each other. For example:\n\n```javascript\ntype Node = {\n  common: string,\n};\n\ntype Foo = {\n  // extends Node\n  foo: string,\n};\n\ntype Bar = {\n  // extends Node\n  bar: number,\n};\n```\n\nWill be transformed into:\n\n```javascript\ntype Node = {\n  type: 'Foo',\n  _Foo: void,\n  common: string,\n  foo: string,\n} | {\n  type: 'Bar',\n  _Bar: void,\n  common: string,\n  bar: number,\n};\n\ntype Foo = {\n  type: 'Foo',\n  _Foo: void,\n  common: string,\n  foo: string,\n};\n\ntype Bar = {\n  type: 'Bar',\n  _Foo: void,\n  common: string,\n  bar: number,\n};\n```\n\nA few things to note:\n\n1. The type `Node` would more ideally be compiled into `Foo | Bar` but then the\ndisjoint union cannot be properly refined. For now we have to duplicate the\ncomplete definitions.\n2.

License Grants and Conditions\n\n2.1. Grants\n\n     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\n     non-exclusive license:\n\n     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)\n        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,\n        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its\n        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or\n        as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for\n        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its\n        Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n\n2.2. Effective Date\n\n     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\n     become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\n     distributes such Contribution.\n\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n\n     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\n     this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\n     distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n     Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n     Contributor:\n\n     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n\n     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n        Version); or\n\n     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n        its Contributions.\n\n     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n     or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n     the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\n     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n     License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\n     permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\n\n     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n     Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to\n     grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\n\n     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\n     applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\n     equivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\n\n     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\n     Section 2.1.\n\n\n3. Responsibilities\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\n     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n     Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the\n        recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n     License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or\n     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the\n     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the\n     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n     jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,\n   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\n   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\n   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a\n   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under\n   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\n   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary\n   skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing\n     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into\n     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are\n     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the\n     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have\n     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such\n     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt\n     of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n     2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis,\n   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,\n   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free\n   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.\n   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software\n   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,\n   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\n   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential\n   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under\n   this License except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\n   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\n   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\n   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may\n   not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts\n   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of\n   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\n   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing\n   in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or\n   counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that\n   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not\n   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n      distinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\n      of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\n      or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n      steward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n      such modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\n      Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is\n      Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of\n      the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be\n      attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is subject to the\n      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n      2.0.

Because Babel 7\nwill be released as `@babel/core` instead of `babel-core`, maintainers have\nno way to do that transition without making a breaking change. e.g.\n\n```js\npeerDependencies: {\n  \"babel-core\": \"6.x\"\n}\n```\ncannot change to\n\n```js\npeerDependencies: {\n  \"@babel/core\": \"6.x\"\n}\n```\n\nwithout it being a breaking change.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo address this, we're releasing this bridge package, to allow users to do\n\n\n```js\npeerDependencies: {\n  \"babel-core\": \"6.x | ^7.0.0-bridge\"\n}\n```\n\nthen where users of this package would originally have done\n\n```sh\nnpm i some-package babel-core\n```\n\nto install Babel 6, they could now do\n\n\n```sh\nnpm i some-package babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge @babel/core\n```\n\nto install the bridge package, and install Babel 7's core.",

    "description": "The Babel preset for Expo projects",
    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# babel-preset-expo\n\nThis preset extends the default React Native preset (`metro-react-native-babel-preset`) and adds support for decorators, tree-shaking web packages, and loading font icons with optional native dependencies if they're installed.\n\nYou can use this preset in any React Native project as a drop-in replacement for `metro-react-native-babel-preset`. If your project isn't using native font loading or web support then this preset will only add support for decorators with `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` - this is mostly used for supporting legacy community libraries.\n\nIf you start your **web** project with `@expo/webpack-config` or `npx expo start` and your project doesn't contain a `babel.config.js` or a `.babelrc` then it will default to using `babel-preset-expo` for loading.\n\nIf you have problems with the code in this repository, please file issues & bug reports\nat https://github.com/expo/expo. Thanks!\n\n## Expo Bundler Spec Compliance\n\nA bundler must follow these requirements if they are to be considered spec compliant for use with a **universal React** (Expo) project.\n\n### Babel Loader\n\nThe babel loading mechanism must include the following properties on its `caller`.\n\n#### platform\n\nA `platform` property denoting the target platform. If the `platform` is not defined, it will default to using `web` when the `bundler` is `webpack` -- this is temporary and will throw an error in the future.\n\n| Value     | Description             |\n| --------- | ----------------------- |\n| `ios`     | Runs on iOS devices     |\n| `android` | Runs on Android devices |\n| `web`     | Runs in web browsers    |\n\n#### bundler\n\nA `bundler` property denoting the name of the bundler that is being used to create the JavaScript bundle.\nIf the `bundler` is not defined, it will default to checking if a `babel-loader` is used, if so then `webpack` will be used, otherwise it will default to `metro`.\n\n| Value     | Description                      |\n| --------- | -------------------------------- |\n| `metro`   | Bundling with [Metro][metro]     |\n| `webpack` | Bundling with [Webpack][webpack] |\n\n[metro]: https://facebook.github.io/metro/\n[webpack]: https://webpack.js.org/\n\n## Options\n\n### [`jsxRuntime`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#runtime)\n\n`classic | automatic`, defaults to `automatic`\n\n- `automatic` automatically convert JSX to JS without the need to `import React from 'react'` in every file. Be sure to follow the rest of the [setup guide](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html#how-to-upgrade-to-the-new-jsx-transform) after enabling this, otherwise ESLint and other tools will throw warnings.\n- `classic` does not automatically import anything, React must imported into every file that uses JSX syntax.\n\n```js\n[\n  'babel-preset-expo',\n  {\n    jsxRuntime: 'classic',\n  },\n];\n```\n\nThis property is passed down to [`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). This flag does nothing when `native.useTransformReactJSXExperimental` is set to `true` because `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` is omitted.\n\n### [`jsxImportSource`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#importsource)\n\n`string`, defaults to `react`\n\nThis option allows specifying a custom import source for importing functions.\n\n```js\n[\n  'babel-preset-expo',\n  {\n    jsxRuntime: 'automatic',\n    jsxImportSource: 'react',\n  },\n];\n```\n\nThis property is passed down to [`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). This options does nothing when `jsxRuntime` is not set to `automatic`.\n\n### [`lazyImports`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy)\n\nChanges Babel's compiled `import` statements to be lazily evaluated when their imported bindings are used for the first time.\n\n_Note:_ this option has an effect only when the `disableImportExportTransform` option is set to `false`. On Android and iOS, `disableImportExportTransform` defaults to `false`, and on web it defaults to `true` to allow for tree shaking.\n\nThis can improve the initial load time of your app because evaluating dependencies up front is sometimes entirely un-necessary, particularly when the dependencies have no side effects.\n\nThe value of `lazyImports` has a few possible effects:\n\n- `null` - [metro-react-native-babel-preset](https://github.com/facebook/metro/tree/master/packages/metro-react-native-babel-preset) will handle it. (Learn more about it here: https://github.com/facebook/metro/commit/23e3503dde5f914f3e642ef214f508d0a699851d)\n\n- `false` - No lazy initialization of any imported module.\n\n- `true` - Lazy-init all imported modules except local imports (e.g., `./foo`), certain Expo packages that have side effects, and the two cases mentioned [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy).\n\n- `Array<string>` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.\n\n- `(string) => boolean` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.\n\n  If you choose to do this, you can also access the list of Expo packages that have side effects by using `const lazyImportsBlacklist = require('babel-preset-expo/lazy-imports-blacklist');` which returns a `Set`.\n\n**default:** `null`\n\n```js\n[\n    'babel-preset-expo',\n    {\n        lazyImports: true\n    }\n],\n```\n\n### `web.disableImportExportTransform`\n\nEnabling this option will allow your project to run with older JavaScript syntax (i.e. `module.exports`). This option will break tree shaking and increase your bundle size, but will eliminate the following error when `module.exports` is used:\n\n> `TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'exports' of object '#<Object>'`\n\n**default:** `false` when using Webpack. `true` otherwise.\n\n```js\n[\n    'babel-preset-expo',\n    {\n        web: { disableImportExportTransform: true }\n    }\n],\n```",

Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions.

Throws an error if the\ninput is invalid.\n\n```js\nvar obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);\n```\n\n### bser.dumpToBuffer\n\nSynchronously encodes a value as BSER.\n\n```js\nvar encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']);\nconsole.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello']\n```\n\n### BunserBuf\n\nThe asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.\nYou may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the\ndecoded values via its `value` event.\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log(obj);\n});\n```\n\nThen in your socket `data` event:\n\n```js\nbunser.append(buf);\n```\n\n## Example\n\nRead BSER from socket:\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log('data from socket', obj);\n});\n\nvar socket = net.connect('/socket');\n\nsocket.on('data', function(buf) {\n  bunser.append(buf);\n});\n```\n\nWrite BSER to socket:\n\n```js\nsocket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));\n```",

If the `offset` and `end` are not given,\nthe entire `buf` will be filled. This is meant to be a small simplification to\nallow the creation and filling of a `Buffer` to be done on a single line.\n\nIf the final write of a `fill()` operation falls on a multi-byte character, then\nonly the first bytes of that character that fit into `buf` are written.\n\n## See also\n\n- [buffer-alloc-unsafe](https://github.com/LinusU/buffer-alloc-unsafe) A ponyfill for `Buffer.allocUnsafe`\n- [buffer-alloc](https://github.com/LinusU/buffer-alloc) A ponyfill for `Buffer.alloc`\n- [buffer-from](https://github.com/LinusU/buffer-from) A ponyfill for `Buffer.from`",

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c.

For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

This is so that you may use any ES6 standard Promise compliant library - or, of course, native ES6 Promises.\n\nIf you're running the code on a browser or node version that doesn't include native promises you will need to include a polyfill.  The following polyfills are tested as part of this module's test suite:-\n- [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)'s [ES6 Promise library](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) (which is actually adapted from [Stefan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner)'s [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js)). -  `require('es6-promise').polyfill();`\n- [Getify](https://twitter.com/getify)'s [Native Promise Only library](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) - `require('native-promise-only');`\n- [ES6 Shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim) - `require('es6-shim');`\n- [Calvin Metcalf](https://twitter.com/CWMma)'s [Lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) - `global.Promise = global.Promise || require('lie');`\n\nNote: as of v1.2.0 you can use **denodeify** in the front end.  Pull it in via CommonJS, AMD or simply add to your webpage and it'll be available on `window.denodeify`. \n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install denodeify --save\n```\n\nOr:-\n\n```\nbower install denodeify --save\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nSimple example with [`readFile`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/read-file):-\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar readFile = denodeify(require('fs').readFile);\n\nreadFile('my-file.txt', { encoding: 'UTF-8' })\n  .then(function(text) {\n    console.log(\"My file's contents is: \" + text);\n  });\n```\n\n(Note: you will need to also install [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) with `npm install es6-promise` for this code sample to work within node versions that don't have `Promise` natively available)\n\nMore complex example with `exec`:-\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nYou can also pass in a function as a second argument of `denodeify` that allows you to manipulate the data returned by the wrapped function before it gets passed to the Promise's `reject` or `resolve` functions, for example:-\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n\n  // Throw away stderr data\n  return [err, stdout];\n});\n\nexec('hostname')\n  .then(function(host) {\n    console.log(\"My hostname is: \" + host.replace('\\n', ''));\n  });\n```\n\nOr,\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  return [err, [stdout, stderr]];\n});\n\nexec('my-command')\n  .then(function(results) {\n    console.log(\"stdout is: \" + results[0]);\n    console.log(\"stderr is: \" + results[1]);\n  });\n```\n\nUseful for functions that return multiple arguments, for example [`child_process#exec`](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).\n\n## Credits and collaboration ##\n\nThe lead developer of **denodeify** is [Matt Andrews](http://twitter.com/andrewsmatt) at FT Labs with much help and support from [Kornel Lesiński](https://twitter.com/pornelski).

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

    "description": "Report and remove unused es6 modules",
    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# eslint-plugin-unused-imports\n\nFind and remove unused es6 module imports. It works by splitting up the `no-unused-vars` rule depending on it being an import statement in the AST and providing an autofix rule to remove the nodes if they are imports. This plugin composes the rule `no-unused-vars` of either the typescript or js plugin so be aware that the other plugins needs to be installed and reporting correctly for this to do so.\n\n## _Important for version 1.1_\n\nThe `-ts` rules are deprecated, the package now looks for `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` to exist to decide between the typescript and eslint version.\nThe `-ts` rule will still work, but point to the new rule instead.\n\n## Typescript\n\nIf running typescript with [@typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) make sure to use both `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser`.\n\n## React\n\nIf writing react code you need to install `eslint-plugin-react` and enable the two rules `react/jsx-uses-react` and `react/jsx-uses-vars`. Otherwise all imports for components will be reported unused.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou'll first need to install [ESLint](http://eslint.org) (and [@typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) if using typescript):\n\n```bash\nnpm i eslint --save-dev\n```\n\nNext, install `eslint-plugin-unused-imports`:\n\n```bash\nnpm install eslint-plugin-unused-imports --save-dev\n```\n\n**Note:** If you installed ESLint globally (using the `-g` flag) then you must also install `eslint-plugin-unused-imports` globally.\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd `unused-imports` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"plugins\": [\"unused-imports\"]\n}\n```\n\nThen configure the rules you want to use under the rules section. I can recommend adding a check for underscores, e.g.\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"rules\": {\n\t\t\"no-unused-vars\": \"off\", // or \"@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars\": \"off\",\n\t\t\"unused-imports/no-unused-imports\": \"error\",\n\t\t\"unused-imports/no-unused-vars\": [\n\t\t\t\"warn\",\n\t\t\t{ \"vars\": \"all\", \"varsIgnorePattern\": \"^_\", \"args\": \"after-used\", \"argsIgnorePattern\": \"^_\" }\n\t\t]\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Supported Rules\n\n- `no-unused-imports`\n- `no-unused-vars`",

    "licenseText": "### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)\n\nEsrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is\n[ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)\nrecursive traversing functionality.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nThe following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(ast, {\n    XXXStatement: function (node) {\n        this.visit(node.left);\n        // do something...\n        this.visit(node.right);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nWe can use `Visitor` instance.\n\n```javascript\nvar visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({\n    XXXStatement: function (node) {\n        this.visit(node.left);\n        // do something...\n        this.visit(node.right);\n    }\n});\n\nvisitor.visit(ast);\n```\n\nWe can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.\n\n```javascript\nclass Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {\n    constructor()\n    {\n        super(null);\n    }\n\n    XXXStatement(node) {\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nfunction DerivedVisitor() {\n    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);\n}\nutil.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);\nDerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {\n    this.visit(node.left);\n    // do something...\n    this.visit(node.right);\n};\n```\n\nAnd you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.\n\n```javascript\nfunction DerivedVisitor() {\n    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);\n}\nutil.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);\nDerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {\n    // do something...\n    this.visitChildren(node);\n};\n```\n\nThe `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`.\nWe can use user-defined node types.\n\n```javascript\n// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.\nvar tree = {\n    type: 'TestExpression',\n\n    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.\n    argument: {\n        type: 'Literal',\n        value: 20\n    },\n\n    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.\n    extended: true\n};\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        // Extending the existing traversing rules.\n        childVisitorKeys: {\n            // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]\n            TestExpression: ['argument']\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\nWe can use the `fallback` option as well.\nIf the `fallback` option is `\"iteration\"`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: 'iteration'\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIf the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: function (node) {\n            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {\n                return key !== 'argument'\n            });\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

This native code has to be linked into the project and, in some cases, configured further. These actions require some modifications to the native project files. One of the steps that has to be done with the native configuration is to enable the autolinking mechanism that takes care of including any supported module's native code into the project. The following configuration is required:\n\n### iOS\n\n> Caution! After you have made the following changes you will need to run `pod install` again.\n\n```ruby\n# Podfile\n\nrequire File.join(File.dirname(`node --print \"require.resolve('react-native/package.json')\"`), \"scripts/react_native_pods\")\nrequire File.join(File.dirname(`node --print \"require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')\"`), \"cocoapods.rb\")\nrequire File.join(File.dirname(`node --print \"require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')\"`), \"scripts/autolinking\")\n\n#  ...\n\ntarget \"TargetName\" do\n  use_unimodules!\n  config = use_native_modules!\n  use_react_native!(:path => config[\"reactNativePath\"])\n\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\n### Android\n\n```groovy\n// app/build.gradle\n\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../gradle.groovy\")\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('react-native/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../react.gradle\")\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('expo-updates/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../scripts/create-manifest-android.gradle\")\n\n// ...\n\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../native_modules.gradle\");\napplyNativeModulesAppBuildGradle(project)\n```\n\n```groovy\n// settings.gradle\n\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../gradle.groovy\");\nincludeUnimodulesProjects()\n\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../native_modules.gradle\");\napplyNativeModulesSettingsGradle(settings)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe scripts that are referenced in Gradle and Cocoapods are usually found the related package inside the project's `node_modules` directory. In the case of monorepos (such as Yarn workspaces) the project directory may not contain `node_modules` at all; instead, the modules are likely to be located at the root of the repository. In order to ensure that both cases are supported, we take advantage of the Node dependency resolution strategy. We invoke a subprocess that spawns the simple JavaScript snippet that tries to locate the desired npm package containing the script we need.\n\n- On iOS, we use [`` ` ` `` (backtick)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3159945/running-command-line-commands-within-ruby-script) ([alternative reference](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/Kernel.html#method-i-60)).\n- On Android, we use [String[]#execute](<http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/lang/String[].html#execute()>) to obtain the results from the subprocess' stdout.\n\nThe Node process that is spawned runs [`require.resolve`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/modules.html#modules_require_resolve_request_options) to obtain the path to a module's `package.json`(if you look for the module location using solely module name, you'll be given the path to the file pointed by the `main` attribute from the `package.json` and we need to know the location of the module's root directory). We then assemble the path to the desired script and execute it.\n\nYou can read more about the scripts and libraries used in the examples above in their official READMEs.\n\n# Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome!

You can use the following resize modes to obtain behavior as if you were using the React Native `<Image>` component's `resizeMode` style.\n\n#### `CONTAIN` resize mode\n\nScale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions the width and height of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.\n\n<table>\n  <thead><tr><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody><tr>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575867-aeeb3580-c3d6-11eb-825d-19a847fe30f5.mp4\n</td>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575885-b6124380-c3d6-11eb-8485-75a11832962c.mp4\n</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n#### `COVER` resize mode\n\nScale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both the width and height of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.\n\n<table>\n  <thead><tr><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody><tr>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575871-b1e62600-c3d6-11eb-9435-5dee19791294.mp4\n</td>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575890-b7437080-c3d6-11eb-9c0a-3c563d1ee02a.mp4\n</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n#### `NATIVE` resize mode\n\n> **Android only.**\n\nBy using this resize mode your app will will leverage Android's ability to present a static bitmap while the application is starting up.\nAndroid (unlike iOS) does not support stretching of the provided image during launch, so the application will present the given image centered on the screen at its original dimensions.\n\n<table>\n  <thead><tr><td>Android</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody><tr>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575878-b3afe980-c3d6-11eb-80c1-72441c22e8be.mp4\n</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n> Animation above presents one of our [known issues](#native-mode-pushes-splash-image-up-a-little-bit)\n\nSelecting this resize mode requires some more work to be done in native configuration.\nPlease take a look at the [`res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`](#resdrawablesplashscreenxml) and [`res/drawable/splashscreen_background.png`](#resdrawablesplashscreen_backgroundpng) sections.\n\n### Per-appearance (a.k.a. dark-mode) splash screen\n\n`expo-splash-screen` supports per-appearance splash screens that respond to system appearance changes on iOS 13+ and dark-mode changes on Android 10+.\n\n### StatusBar customization\n\n`expo-splash-screen` allows customization of the StatusBar according to the [ReactNative StatusBar API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/statusbar).\n\n## 📚 API\n\n```tsx\nimport * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';\n```\n\nThe native splash screen that is controlled via this module autohides once the ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is mounted. This means that when your app first `render`s view component, the native splash screen will hide. This default behavior can be prevented by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashscreenpreventautohideasync) and later on [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscreenhideasync).\n\n### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`\n\nThis method makes the native splash screen stay visible until [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscreenhideasync) is called. This must be called before any ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is rendered (either in the global scope of your main component, or when the component renders `null` at the beginning - see [Examples section](#-examples)).\n\nPreventing default autohiding might come in handy if your application needs to prepare/download some resources and/or make some API calls before first rendering some actual view hierarchy.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` that resolves to `true` when preventing autohiding succeeded and to `false` if the native splash screen is already prevented from autohiding (for instance, if you've already called this method).\n`Promise` rejection most likely means that native splash screen cannot be prevented from autohiding (it's already hidden when this method was executed).\n\n### `SplashScreen.hideAsync()`\n\nHides the native splash screen. Only works if the native splash screen has been previously prevented from autohiding by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashscreenpreventautohideasync) method.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` that resolves to `true` once the splash screen becomes hidden and to `false` if the splash screen is already hidden.\n\n## 🗒 Examples\n\n### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in global scope\n\n`App.tsx`\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';\nimport * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';\n\n// Prevent native splash screen from autohiding before App component declaration\nSplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()\n  .then(result => console.log(`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync() succeeded: ${result}`))\n  .catch(console.warn); // it's good to explicitly catch and inspect any error\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    // Hides native splash screen after 2s\n    setTimeout(async () => {\n      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();\n    }, 2000);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! 👋</Text>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',\n  },\n  text: {\n    color: 'white',\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in component that initially renders `null`\n\n`App.tsx`\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';\nimport * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    appIsReady: false,\n  };\n\n  async componentDidMount() {\n    // Prevent native splash screen from autohiding\n    try {\n      await SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.warn(e);\n    }\n    this.prepareResources();\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Method that serves to load resources and make API calls\n   */\n  prepareResources = async () => {\n    await performAPICalls(...);\n    await downloadAssets(...);\n\n    this.setState({ appIsReady: true }, async () => {\n      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (!this.state.appIsReady) {\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! 👋</Text>\n      </View>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',\n  },\n  text: {\n    color: 'white',\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## 💻 Installation in managed Expo projects\n\nRefer to [the SplashScreen section of the Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen/).\n\n## 🖥 Installation in bare React Native projects\n\nFor bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `expo` package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) before continuing.\n\n## Add the package to your dependencies\n\n```\nexpo install expo-splash-screen\n```\n\n## 📱 Configure iOS\n\nRun `npx pod-install` after installing the package.\n\n### Automatic configuration\n\nThe easiest way to configure the splash screen in bare React Native projects is with the expo-splash-screen command. See the [README](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/tree/main/unlinked-packages/configure-splash-screen) for more information, or run `yarn expo-splash-screen --help` in your project.\n\n### Manual Configuration\n\nTo achieve native splash screen (in iOS ecosystem it's called `LaunchScreen`) behavior, you have to provide either a `SplashScreen.storyboard` file or a `SplashScreen.xib` file, and configure your Xcode project accordingly.\n\nThe guide below shows how to configure your Xcode project to use a single image file as a splash screen using a `.storyboard` file (configuration for `.xib` filetype is analogous).\n\n1. [Add an image to `Images.xcassets`](#-add-an-image-to-imagesxcassets)\n2. [Create `SplashScreen.storyboard`](#-create-splashscreenstoryboard)\n3. [Select `Content Mode` for the `ImageView` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`](#-select-content-mode-for-the-imageview-in-splashscreenstoryboard)\n4. [Mark `SplashScreen.storyboard` as the LaunchScreen](#-mark-splashscreenstoryboard-as-the-launchscreen)\n5. [(<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode](#-optional-enable-dark-mode)\n6. [(<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar](#-customize-statusbar)\n\n#### 🛠 Add an image to `Images.xcassets`\n\nFirst you need to add the image file that would serve as a splash screen to your native project's resources.\n\n1. In your Xcode project open the `.xcassets` (often named `Images.xcassets` or `Assets.xcassets`) file.\n2. In the content panel add `New image set` and name it `SplashScreen`.\n3. Provide the splash screen image you've prepared (you have to provide it in three different scales).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addImagesXcassets.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n#### 🛠 Create `SplashScreen.storyboard`\n\nThis is the actual splash screen definition and will be used by the system to render your splash screen.\n\n1. Create a `SplashScreen.storyboard` file.\n2. Add a `View Controller` to the newly created `.storyboard` file:\n   - open `Library` (`+` button on the top-right),\n   - find `View Controller` element,\n   - drag-and-drop it to the `.storyboard` file.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addViewControllerToStoryboard.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n3. Add an `Image View` to the `View Controller`:\n   - first remove other `View` element from `View Controller`,\n   - open `Library` (`+` button on the top-right),\n   - find `Image View` element,\n   - drag-and-drop it as a `View Controller` child in view hierarchy inspector.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addImageViewToStoryboard.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n4. Set `Storyboard ID` to `SplashScreenViewController`:\n   - select `View Controller` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Identity Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - and set `Storyboard ID` to `SplashScreenViewController`.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addStoryboardID.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n5. Tick `Is Initial View Controller` in `SplashScreenViewController`:\n   - select `View Controller` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - and tick `Is Initial View Controller` in View Controller section.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-tickIsInitialViewController.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n6. Configure `Image View` source:\n   - select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - select `SplashScreen` in `Image` parameter).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-configureImageView.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n7. Configure `Background` of the `Image View`:\n   - select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - configure `Background` parameter:\n     - To enter a `#RRGGBB` value you need to select `Custom` option and in the `Colors Popup` that appeared you need to navigate to the second tab and choose `RGB Sliders` from dropdown select.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-selectBackgroundColor.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n#### 🛠 Select `Content Mode` for the `ImageView` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`\n\nThis is how your image will be displayed on the screen.\n\n1. Open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and select `Image View` from `View Controller`.\n2. Navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and locate `Content Mode`.\n3. Select one of the following:\n   - `Aspect Fit` to obtain [CONTAIN resize mode](#contain-resize-mode),\n   - `Aspect Fill` to obtain [COVER resize mode](#cover-resize-mode).\n4. You can always choose other options to achieve different image positioning and scaling.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-selectImageViewContentMode.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n#### 🛠 Mark `SplashScreen.storyboard` as the LaunchScreen\n\nThe newly created `SplashScreen.storyboard` needs to be marked as the `Launch Screen File` in your Xcode project in order to be presented from the very beginning of your application launch.\n\n1. Select your project in `Project Navigator`\n2. Select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `General` tab.\n3. Locate `App Icons and Launch Images` section and `Launch Screen File` option.\n4. Select or enter `SplashScreen` as the value for located option.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-selectLaunchScreen.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode\n\n##### Provide different background colors\n\nDepending on what iOS version your application is targeting, you have to adjust your native project differently to a obtain working per-appearance splash screen view.\n\n##### I'm targeting iOS 11+\n\nYou can take advantage of [`named colors`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/xcode_9/xcode_9.html) in your Xcode project.\n\n1. Create a new `Color Set` and customize its values for different color modes:\n   - in your `.xcassets` directory (either create a new `.xcassets` for colors, or reuse an existing one e.g. with images) create `New Color Set` and name it `SplashScreenBackground`,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and change `Appearance` to `Any, Dark`,\n   - select desired color in `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel for each mode.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-createNamedColor.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n2. Select created `named color` as the `Background` for the `Image View` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`:\n   - open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - configure `Background` parameter by selecting your created `named color` (that should be listed as `SplashScreenBackground`).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-selectNamedColor.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n##### I'm targeting iOS version < 11\n\nYou cannot use [`named colors`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/xcode_9/xcode_9.html) feature in your Xcode project.\nInstead you have to create an additional image set that contains small 1x1px images, each with the desired background color. Then, you'll use this additional image resource as a background in the splash screen view.\n\nYou can use this online generator to obtain 1x1px `.png` images with desired colors: http://www.1x1px.me.\n\n1. Create `SplashScreenBackground` `Image Set` with desired background colors for each mode in your `Images.xcassets` directory:\n   - open your `.xcassets` directory with images,\n   - in the content panel add `New image set` and name it `SplashScreenBackground`,\n   - convert this `Image set` to support `Dark Appearance` by navigating to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and changing `Appearance` to `Any, Dark`,\n   - provide images with colors for every mode (you can generate color 1x1px images using http://www.1x1px.me).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addSplashScreenBackgroundImages.png\" height=\"250\" />\n</details>\n\n2. Update `SplashScreen.storyboard` to consist of a single top-level `View` with two `Image View` subviews (solid-colored image in the background and actual splash screen image in the foreground):\n\n   - open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and replace `Image View` with a plain `View` (search `Library` for it and drag&drop it in place of current `Image View`),\n   - add two\n\n3. Configure first `Image View` (background color):\n   - configure attributes in `Attributes Inspector`:\n     - set `Image` to `SplashScreenBackground` (prepared in previous step),\n     - set `Content Mode` to `Scale To Fill` (color needs to take all available space),\n   - make this subview take all available space in parent view:\n     - open `Add new constraints` bottom menu,\n     - make sure `Constrain to margin` is not checked,\n     - for every input, open the dropdown and select `View` (parent view reference) and set `0` as the value,\n     - once every side is covered (`0` value and parent view reference selected in dropdown) hit `Add 4 Constraints`,\n     - observe that in `View Hierarchy Inspector` constraints are added and `Image View` resized to take whole place of parent view.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-createBackgroundImageView.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n4. Configure second `Image View` (actual splash screen image):\n   - select second `Image View` and select correct `Image` in `Attributes Inspector` alongside with desired `Content Mode`,\n   - make this subview take all available space in parent view (see previous step).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addConstraintsToImageViews.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n##### Provide different splash screen image\n\nYou might want to add a separate image for `dark` mode. If the system is switched to `dark` mode, it would pick this different image instead of the normal one and present it in the splash screen view.\n\n1. In your Xcode project open `SplashScreen` (created in previous section).\n2. Convert this asset to support `Dark Appearance`:\n\n- navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n- locate `Appearances` section and select `Any, Dark`,\n- provide image for `dark mode` by dropping it to the correct box.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addDarkImagesXcassets.png\" height=\"280\" />\n</details>\n\n###### Background color when you want to support iOS < 11\n\nIf you're targeting a version of iOS < 11 then you cannot use `named color` feature and instead you need to generate images with desired background colors that are going to be used as the background for splash screen view.\nThere is this awesome 1x1px png online generator: http://www.1x1px.me (use it to generate two 1x1px images with desired background colors for different color modes).\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar\n\nYou might want to customize the StatusBar appearance during the time the SplashScreen is being shown.\n\n1. Customize `StatusBar hiding` flag:\n\n- open main project view, select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `Info` tab,\n- add or modify `Status bar initially hidden` attribute with desired value.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-statusBar-hidden.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n2. Customize `StatusBar style` option:\n\n- open main project view, select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `Info` tab,\n- add or modify `Status bar style` attribute with desired value.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-statusBar-style.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n## 🤖 Configure Android\n\nTo achieve fully-native splash screen behavior, `expo-splash-screen` needs to be hooked into the native view hierarchy and consume some resources that have to be placed under `/android/app/src/res` directory.\n\n### Automatic configuration\n\nThe easiest way to configure the splash screen in bare React Native projects is with the expo-splash-screen command. See the [README](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/tree/main/unlinked-packages/configure-splash-screen) for more information, or run `yarn expo-splash-screen --help` in your project.\n\n### Manual Configuration\n\n1. [Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen_image.png`](#-configure-resdrawablesplashscreen_imagepng)\n2. [Configure `res/values/colors.xml`](#-configure-resvaluescolorsxml)\n3. [Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`](#-configure-resdrawablesplashscreenxml)\n4. [Configure `res/values/styles.xml`](#-configure-resvaluesstylesxml)\n5. [Configure `AndroidManifest.xml`](#-configure-androidmanifestxml)\n6. [(<em>optional</em>) Customzine `resizeMode`](#-optional-customize-resizemode)\n7. [(<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode](#-optional-enable-dark-mode-1)\n8. [(<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar](#-customize-statusbar-1)\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen_image.png`\n\nYou have to provide your splash screen image and place it under the `res/drawable` directory.\nThis image will be loaded as soon as Android mounts your application's native view hierarchy.\n\n##### `NATIVE` mode adjustments\n\nIf you've overridden `<string name=\"expo_splash_screen_resize_mode\">native</string>` mode in [`res/values/strings.xml`](#-optional-customize-resizemode), you need to do a few additional steps.\n\nIn your application's `res` directory you might want to have a number of `drawable-X` sub-directories (where `X` is the different DPI for different devices). They store different versions of images that are picked based on the device's DPI (for more information please see [this official Android docs](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskProvideAltBmp)).\n\nTo achieve proper scaling of your splash screen image on every device you should have following directories:\n\n- `res/drawable-mdpi` - scale 1x - resources for medium-density (mdpi) screens (~160dpi). (This is the baseline density.)\n- `res/drawable-hdpi` - scale 1.5x - resources for high-density (hdpi) screens (~240dpi).\n- `res/drawable-xhdpi` - scale 2x - resources for extra-high-density (xhdpi) screens (~320dpi).\n- `res/drawable-xxhdpi` - scale 3x - resources for extra-extra-high-density (xxhdpi) screens (~480dpi).\n- `res/drawable-xxxhdpi` - scale 4x - resources for extra-extra-extra-high-density (xxxhdpi) uses (~640dpi).\n\nEach of directories mentioned above should contain the same `splashscreen_image.png` file, but with a different resolution (pay attention to scale factors).\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `res/values/colors.xml`\n\nThis file contains colors that are reused across your application at the native level.\nUpdate the file with the following content or create one if missing:\n\n```diff\n<resources>\n+ <color name=\"splashscreen_background\">#AABBCC</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->\n  <!-- Other colors defined for your application -->\n</resources>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`\n\nThis file contains the description of how the splash screen view should be drawn by the Android system.\nCreate the file with the following content:\n\n```diff\n+ <layer-list xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\">\n+   <item android:drawable=\"@color/splashscreen_background\"/>\n+ </layer-list>\n```\n\n#### `NATIVE` mode adjustments\n\nIf you've overridden `<string name=\"expo_splash_screen_resize_mode\">native</string>` mode in [`res/values/strings.xml`](#-optional-customize-resizemode), you shoulw add:\n\n```diff\n<layer-list xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\">\n  <item android:drawable=\"@color/splashscreen_background\"/>\n+ <item>\n+   <bitmap android:gravity=\"center\" android:src=\"@drawable/splashscreen_image\"/>\n+ </item>\n</layer-list>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `res/values/styles.xml`\n\nLocate your main activity theme in `/android/app/src/res/values/styles.xml` or create one if missing.\n\n```diff\n  <!-- Main activity theme. -->\n  <style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\n+   <item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@drawable/splashscreen</item> <!-- this line instructs the system to use 'splashscreen.xml' as a background of the whole application -->\n    <!-- Other style properties -->\n  </style>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `AndroidManifest.xml`\n\nAdjust your application's main `AndroidManifest.xml` to contain an `android:theme` property pointing to the style that contains your splash screen configuration:\n\n```diff\n<manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    package=\"com.example.myapp\">\n\n  ...\n\n  <application ...>\n\n+   <!-- Ensure that 'android:theme' property is pointing to the style containing native splash screen reference - see 'styles.xml' -->\n    <activity\n      android:name=\".MainActivity\"\n+     android:theme=\"@style/AppTheme\"\n      ...\n    >\n      ...\n    </activity>\n  </application>\n\n</manifest>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize `resizeMode`\n\nThe default image [`resizeMode`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/%40kudo/modularize-expo-splash-screen/packages/expo-splash-screen#built-in-splash-screen-image-resize-modes) is [`CONTAIN`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/%40kudo/modularize-expo-splash-screen/packages/expo-splash-screen#contain-resize-mode). If you want to have different `resizeMode`, you need to override in `res/values/strings.xml`.\n\n```diff\n--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n <resources>\n   <string name=\"app_name\">sdk42</string>\n+  <string name=\"expo_splash_screen_resize_mode\">contain|cover|native</string>\n</resources>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode\n\n##### Provide different background colors - `res/values-night/colors.png`\n\nIf you want to have different background colors in your splash screen depending on the system color mode, you need to create a similar file to `colors.xml`, but in the directory `res/values-night`.\nValues in this file are going to picked by the system when it is switched to `dark` mode.\n\n```diff\n<resources>\n+ <color name=\"splashscreen_background\">#AABBCC</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->\n</resources>\n```\n\n##### Provide different splash screen image - `res/drawable-night/splashscreen_image.png`\n\nYou might want to provide a separate splash screen image for dark mode usage, and place it under the `res/drawable-night` directory with exactly the same name as the normal one.\nThis step is optional, because you might want to have the same image in both `light` and `dark` modes (e.g. you have just a light-themed logo and you want to have different background colors in different modes).\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar\n\nYou might want to customize the StatusBar appearance during the time the SplashScreen is being shown.\n\n1. Customize `StatusBar hiding` flag\n\nTo have the StatusBar completely hidden you need to update your `res/values/styles.xml` file with the following entry (to prevent StatusBar from hiding either remove this entry or enter `false` as the value):\n\n```diff\n  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->\n  <style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\n    <item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@drawable/splashscreen</item>\n+   <item name=\"android:windowFullscreen\">true</item>\n    <!-- Other style properties -->\n  </style>\n```\n\nIf you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night`, `res/values-night-v23`, etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.\n\nRead more about `android:windowFullscreen` flag in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowFullscreen).\n\n2. Customize `StatusBar style` option\n\nThis option is only available for Android devices running Android 6.0 or greater.\nTo enforce `light` or `dark` StatusBar style for given system color mode, you have to prepare or update your `res/values-v23/styles.xml` file with the following entry (as of this option being supported since API 23, you have to configure specifically named directory containing separate configuration files):\n\n```diff\n  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->\n  <style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\n    <item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@drawable/splashscreen</item>\n+   <item name=\"android:windowLightStatusBar\">true|false</item>\n    <!-- Other style properties -->\n  </style>\n```\n\nAvailable values:\n\n- `true` for having dark-colored icons,\n- `false` for having light-colored icons.\n\nIf you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night-v23` (for dark color mode), etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.\n\nRead more about `android:windowLightStatusBar` flag in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowLightStatusBar).\n\nTo read more about Android multi-API-level support see [this official documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources).\n\n3. Customize `StatusBar color` option (a.k.a. `background color` of the StatusBar component)\n\nTo achieve custom background color you need to create a new color resource and provide it to the SplashScreen `style` description.\n\nCreate new color resource in your `res/values/colors.xml` (if your application supports dark mode, consider adding different color in `res/values-night/colors.xml` file):\n\n```diff\n  <resources>\n    <!-- Below line is handled by '@expo/configure-splash-screen' command and it's discouraged to modify it manually -->\n    <color name=\"splashscreen_background\">#D0D0C0</color>\n+   <color name=\"splashscreen_statusbar_color\">#(AA)RRGGBB</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->\n  </resources>\n```\n\nUpdate your `res/values/styles.xml` file with the following entry:\n\n```diff\n  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->\n  <style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\n    <item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@drawable/splashscreen</item>\n+   <item name=\"android:statusBarColor\">@color/splashscreen_statusbar_color</item>\n    <!-- Other style properties -->\n  </style>\n```\n\nIf you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night`, `res/values-night-v23`, etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.\n\nRead more about `android:statusBarColor` option in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#statusBarColor).\n\n4. Customize `StatusBar translucent` flag\n\nWhen the StatusBar is translucent, the app will be able to draw under the StatusBar component area.\n\nTo make the StatusBar translucent update your `res/values/strings.xml` file with the following content:\n\n```diff\n--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n <resources>\n   <string name=\"app_name\">sdk42</string>\n+  <string name=\"expo_splash_screen_status_bar_translucent\">true</string>\n</resources>\n```\n\n## 👏 Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome! Please refer to guidelines described in the [contributing guide](https://github.com/expo/expo#contributing).\n\n## ❓ Known issues\n\n### iOS caching\n\nSplash Screens on iOS apps can sometimes encounter a caching issue where the previous image will flash before showing the new, intended image. When this occurs, we recommend you try power cycling your device and uninstalling and re-installing the application. However, the caching sometimes can persist for a day or two so be patient if the aforementioned steps were unable to resolve the issue.\n\n### `NATIVE` mode pushes splash image up a little bit\n\nSee [`NATIVE`](#native-resize-mode) mode preview above.\n\n> We are aware of this issue and unfortunately haven't been able to provide a solution as of yet. This is on our immediate roadmap...\n\n## ⬆️ Migrate from old versions\n\n### Migrate from expo-splash-screen < 0.12.0\n\nWe try to keep changes backward compatible, the code for `expo-splash-screen` will still work as it used to be. However, if you are going to migrate as new style API, here are the steps:\n\n1. Migrate your project from react-native-unimodules to expo-modules-core\n2. Remove expo-splash-screen code from MainActivity\n\n```diff\n--- a/android/app/src/main/java/com/helloworld/MainActivity.java\n+++ b/android/app/src/main/java/com/helloworld/MainActivity.java\n import com.facebook.react.ReactRootView;\n import com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView;\n\n-import expo.modules.splashscreen.singletons.SplashScreen;\n-import expo.modules.splashscreen.SplashScreenImageResizeMode;\n-\n public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {\n   @Override\n   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n     // This is required for expo-splash-screen.\n     setTheme(R.style.AppTheme);\n     super.onCreate(null);\n-    // SplashScreen.show(...) has to be called after super.onCreate(...)\n-    // Below line is handled by '@expo/configure-splash-screen' command and it's discouraged to modify it manually\n-    SplashScreen.show(this, SplashScreenImageResizeMode.CONTAIN, ReactRootView.class, false);\n   }\n```\n\n3. Override default `resizeMode` and `statusBarTranslucent` in stings.xml\n\n```diff\n--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n <resources>\n   <string name=\"app_name\">sdk42</string>\n+  <string name=\"expo_splash_screen_resize_mode\">contain</string>\n+  <string name=\"expo_splash_screen_status_bar_translucent\">false</string>\n</resources>\n```\n\n## 🏅 Hall Of Fame\n\nThis module is based on a solid work from (many thanks for that 👏):\n\n- [react-native-splash-screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen)\n- [react-native-bootsplash](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-bootsplash)\n- [react-native-make](https://github.com/bamlab/react-native-make)",

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# The flow-parser package\n\nThis package contains the Flow parser in its compiled-to-JavaScript form.\n\n# What is Flow\n\nSee [flow.org](https://flow.org/). The code for the Flow parser [lives on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/flow/tree/master/src/parser).\n\n# What is the Flow Parser\n\nThe Flow Parser is a JavaScript parser written in OCaml. It produces an AST that conforms to the [ESTree spec](https://github.com/estree/estree) and that mostly matches what [esprima](http://esprima.org/) produces. The Flow Parser can be compiled to native code or can be compiled to JavaScript using [js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/). This npm package contains the Flow parser compiled to JavaScript.\n\n# Usage\n\nYou can use the Flow parser in your browser or in node. To use in node you can just do\n\n```JavaScript\nrequire('flow-parser').parse('1+1', {});\n```\n\nTo use in the browser, you can add\n\n```HTML\n<script src=\"flow_parser.js\"></script>\n```\n\nwhich will make the `flow` object available to use like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nflow.parse('1+1', {});\n```\n\n## Options\n\nThe second argument to `flow.parse` is the options object. Currently supported options:\n\n* `all_comments` (boolean, default `true`) - include a list of all comments from the whole program\n* `comments` (boolean, default `true`) - attach comments to AST nodes (`leadingComments` and `trailingComments`)\n* `enums` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of Flow enums\n* `esproposal_decorators` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of decorators\n* `esproposal_export_star_as` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of `export * as` syntax\n* `tokens` (boolean, default `false`) - include a list of all parsed tokens in a top-level `tokens` property\n* `types` (boolean, default `true`) - enable parsing of Flow types\n* `use_strict` (boolean, default `false`) - treat the file as strict, without needing a \"use strict\" directive",

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

    "licenseText": "https-proxy-agent\n================\n### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)\n\nThis module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified\nHTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.\n\nSpecifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary \"proxy\"\nserver and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to\nopen a direct TCP connection to the destination server.\n\nSince this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other\nprotocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).\nSee the \"Examples\" section below for more.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install https-proxy-agent\n```\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n#### `https` module example\n\n``` js\nvar url = require('url');\nvar https = require('https');\nvar HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');\n\n// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to\nvar proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';\nconsole.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);\n\n// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to\nvar endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';\nconsole.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);\nvar options = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information\nvar agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);\noptions.agent = agent;\n\nhttps.get(options, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\n#### `ws` WebSocket connection example\n\n``` js\nvar url = require('url');\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');\n\n// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to\nvar proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';\nconsole.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);\n\n// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to\nvar endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\nconsole.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);\n\n// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information\nvar options = url.parse(proxy);\n\nvar agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);\n\n// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection\nvar socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });\n\nsocket.on('open', function () {\n  console.log('\"open\" event!');\n  socket.send('hello world');\n});\n\nsocket.on('message', function (data, flags) {\n  console.log('\"message\" event! %j %j', data, flags);\n  socket.close();\n});\n```\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)\n\nThe `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects\nto the specified \"HTTP(s) proxy server\" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket\nrequests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an\n\"options\" object with more specific properties:\n\n  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.\n  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.\n  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling",

    "description": "An incremental implementation of MurmurHash3",
    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The default resolver will already use PnP.\n\nSimply add the resolver to your configuration. For example, a minimal `jest.config.js` would be as such:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  resolver: require.resolve(`jest-pnp-resolver`)\n};\n```\n\n## License (MIT)\n\n> **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison**\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It supports TTL based expiry, making it suitable as a cache or a persistent key-value store.\n\n## Features\n\nThere are a few existing modules similar to Keyv, however Keyv is different because it:\n\n- Isn't bloated\n- Has a simple Promise based API\n- Suitable as a TTL based cache or persistent key-value store\n- [Easily embeddable](#add-cache-support-to-your-module) inside another module\n- Works with any storage that implements the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) API\n- Handles all JSON types plus `Buffer`\n- Supports namespaces\n- Wide range of [**efficient, well tested**](#official-storage-adapters) storage adapters\n- Connection errors are passed through (db failures won't kill your app)\n- Supports the current active LTS version of Node.js or higher\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall Keyv.\n\n```\nnpm install --save keyv\n```\n\nBy default everything is stored in memory, you can optionally also install a storage adapter.\n\n```\nnpm install --save @keyv/redis\nnpm install --save @keyv/mongo\nnpm install --save @keyv/sqlite\nnpm install --save @keyv/postgres\nnpm install --save @keyv/mysql\nnpm install --save @keyv/etcd\n```\n\nCreate a new Keyv instance, passing your connection string if applicable. Keyv will automatically load the correct storage adapter.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\n\n// One of the following\nconst keyv = new Keyv();\nconst keyv = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('sqlite://path/to/database.sqlite');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('etcd://localhost:2379');\n\n// Handle DB connection errors\nkeyv.on('error', err => console.log('Connection Error', err));\n\nawait keyv.set('foo', 'expires in 1 second', 1000); // true\nawait keyv.set('foo', 'never expires'); // true\nawait keyv.get('foo'); // 'never expires'\nawait keyv.delete('foo'); // true\nawait keyv.clear(); // undefined\n```\n\n### Namespaces\n\nYou can namespace your Keyv instance to avoid key collisions and allow you to clear only a certain namespace while using the same database.\n\n```js\nconst users = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'users' });\nconst cache = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'cache' });\n\nawait users.set('foo', 'users'); // true\nawait cache.set('foo', 'cache'); // true\nawait users.get('foo'); // 'users'\nawait cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'\nawait users.clear(); // undefined\nawait users.get('foo'); // undefined\nawait cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'\n```\n\n### Custom Serializers\n\nKeyv uses [`json-buffer`](https://github.com/dominictarr/json-buffer) for data serialization to ensure consistency across different backends.\n\nYou can optionally provide your own serialization functions to support extra data types or to serialize to something other than JSON.\n\n```js\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ serialize: JSON.stringify, deserialize: JSON.parse });\n```\n\n**Warning:** Using custom serializers means you lose any guarantee of data consistency. You should do extensive testing with your serialisation functions and chosen storage engine.\n\n## Official Storage Adapters\n\nThe official storage adapters are covered by [over 150 integration tests](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/actions/workflows/tests.yaml) to guarantee consistent behaviour. They are lightweight, efficient wrappers over the DB clients making use of indexes and native TTLs where available.\n\nDatabase | Adapter | Native TTL\n---|---|---\nRedis | [@keyv/redis](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/redis) | Yes\nMongoDB | [@keyv/mongo](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mongo) | Yes \nSQLite | [@keyv/sqlite](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/sqlite) | No \nPostgreSQL | [@keyv/postgres](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/postgres) | No \nMySQL | [@keyv/mysql](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mysql) | No \nEtcd | [@keyv/etcd](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/etcd) | Yes\nMemcache | [@keyv/memcache](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/memcache) | Yes\n\n## Third-party Storage Adapters\n\nYou can also use third-party storage adapters or build your own. Keyv will wrap these storage adapters in TTL functionality and handle complex types internally.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\nconst myAdapter = require('./my-storage-adapter');\n\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ store: myAdapter });\n```\n\nAny store that follows the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) api will work.\n\n```js\nnew Keyv({ store: new Map() });\n```\n\nFor example, [`quick-lru`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) is a completely unrelated module that implements the Map API.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\nconst QuickLRU = require('quick-lru');\n\nconst lru = new QuickLRU({ maxSize: 1000 });\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ store: lru });\n```\n\nThe following are third-party storage adapters compatible with Keyv:\n\n- [quick-lru](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) - Simple \"Least Recently Used\" (LRU) cache\n- [keyv-file](https://github.com/zaaack/keyv-file) - File system storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-dynamodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-dynamodb) - DynamoDB storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-lru](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-lru) - LRU storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-null](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-null) - Null storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-firestore ](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/keyv-firestore) – Firebase Cloud Firestore adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-mssql](https://github.com/pmorgan3/keyv-mssql) - Microsoft Sql Server adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-azuretable](https://github.com/howlowck/keyv-azuretable) - Azure Table Storage/API adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-arango](https://github.com/TimMikeladze/keyv-arango) - ArangoDB storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-momento](https://github.com/momentohq/node-keyv-adaptor/) - Momento storage adapter for Keyv\n\n## Add Cache Support to your Module\n\nKeyv is designed to be easily embedded into other modules to add cache support. The recommended pattern is to expose a `cache` option in your modules options which is passed through to Keyv. Caching will work in memory by default and users have the option to also install a Keyv storage adapter and pass in a connection string, or any other storage that implements the `Map` API.\n\nYou should also set a namespace for your module so you can safely call `.clear()` without clearing unrelated app data.\n\nInside your module:\n\n```js\nclass AwesomeModule {\n\tconstructor(opts) {\n\t\tthis.cache = new Keyv({\n\t\t\turi: typeof opts.cache === 'string' && opts.cache,\n\t\t\tstore: typeof opts.cache !== 'string' && opts.cache,\n\t\t\tnamespace: 'awesome-module'\n\t\t});\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nNow it can be consumed like this:\n\n```js\nconst AwesomeModule = require('awesome-module');\n\n// Caches stuff in memory by default\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule();\n\n// After npm install --save keyv-redis\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: 'redis://localhost' });\n\n// Some third-party module that implements the Map API\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: some3rdPartyStore });\n```\n\n## Compression\n\nKeyv supports `gzip` and `brotli` compression. To enable compression, pass the `compress` option to the constructor.\n\n```js\nconst KeyvGzip = require('@keyv/compress-gzip');\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\n\nconst keyvGzip = new KeyvGzip();\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ compression: KeyvGzip });\n```\n\nYou can also pass a custom compression function to the `compression` option. Following the pattern of the official compression adapters.\n\n### Want to build your own? \n\nGreat! Keyv is designed to be easily extended. You can build your own compression adapter by following the pattern of the official compression adapters based on this interface:\n\n```typescript\ninterface CompressionAdapter {\n\tasync compress(value: any, options?: any);\n\tasync decompress(value: any, options?: any);\n\tasync serialize(value: any);\n\tasync deserialize(value: any);\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to the interface, you can test it with our compression test suite using @keyv/test-suite:\n\n```js\nconst {keyvCompresstionTests} = require('@keyv/test-suite');\nconst KeyvGzip = require('@keyv/compress-gzip');\n\nkeyvCompresstionTests(test, new KeyvGzip());\n```\n\n## API\n\n### new Keyv([uri], [options])\n\nReturns a new Keyv instance.\n\nThe Keyv instance is also an `EventEmitter` that will emit an `'error'` event if the storage adapter connection fails.\n\n### uri\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nThe connection string URI.\n\nMerged into the options object as options.uri.\n\n### options\n\nType: `Object`\n\nThe options object is also passed through to the storage adapter. Check your storage adapter docs for any extra options.\n\n#### options.namespace\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `'keyv'`\n\nNamespace for the current instance.\n\n#### options.ttl\n\nType: `Number`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nDefault TTL. Can be overridden by specififying a TTL on `.set()`.\n\n#### options.compression\n\nType: `@keyv/compress-<compression_package_name>`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nCompression package to use. See [Compression](#compression) for more details.\n\n#### options.serialize\n\nType: `Function`<br>\nDefault: `JSONB.stringify`\n\nA custom serialization function.\n\n#### options.deserialize\n\nType: `Function`<br>\nDefault: `JSONB.parse`\n\nA custom deserialization function.\n\n#### options.store\n\nType: `Storage adapter instance`<br>\nDefault: `new Map()`\n\nThe storage adapter instance to be used by Keyv.\n\n#### options.adapter\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nSpecify an adapter to use. e.g `'redis'` or `'mongodb'`.\n\n### Instance\n\nKeys must always be strings.

The container will launch all services within your workspace.\n\n## Available Commands\n\nOnce the project is running, you can execute a variety of commands. The root workspace and each subpackage contain a `package.json` file with a  `scripts` field listing all the commands that can be executed from that directory. This project also supports native `yarn`, and `docker` commands.\n\nHere, we'll cover the primary commands that can be executed from the root directory. Unless otherwise noted, these commands can also be executed from a subpackage. If executed from a subpackage, they will only affect that subpackage, rather than the entire workspace.\n\n### `yarn`\n\nThe `yarn` command installs yarn in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn bootstrap`\n\nThe `yarn bootstrap` command installs all dependencies in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn test:services:start`\n\nThe `yarn test:services:start` command starts up the project's Docker container, launching all services in the workspace. This command must be executed from the root directory.\n\n### `yarn test:services:stop`\n\nThe `yarn test:services:stop` command brings down the project's Docker container, halting all services. This command must be executed from the root directory.\n\n### `yarn test`\n\nThe `yarn test` command runs all tests in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn clean`\n\nThe `yarn clean` command removes yarn and all dependencies installed by yarn. After executing this command, you must repeat the steps in *Setting up your workspace* to rebuild your workspace.\n\n## Contributing Changes\n\nNow that you've set up your workspace, you're ready to contribute changes to the `keyv` repository.\n\n1) Make any changes that you would like to contribute in your local workspace.\n2) After making these changes, ensure that the project's tests still pass by executing the `yarn test` command in the root directory.\n3) Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.\n4) Navigate to the original `keyv` repository and go the *Pull Requests* tab.\n5) Click the *New pull request* button, and open a pull request for the branch in your repository that contains your changes.\n6) Once your pull request is created, ensure that all checks have passed and that your branch has no conflicts with the base branch. If there are any issues, resolve these changes in your local repository, and then commit and push them to git.\n7) Similarly, respond to any reviewer comments or requests for changes by making edits to your local repository and pushing them to Git.\n8) Once the pull request has been reviewed, those with write access to the branch will be able to merge your changes into the `keyv` repository.\n\nIf you need more information on the steps to create a pull request, you can find a detailed walkthrough in the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\n\n## License\n\nMIT © Jared Wray",

This project provides neatly organized JSON files representing that data.\n\nSee `data/` for all the JSON files available. The `registry.json` file contains all records in a flat array and `meta.json` contains its metadata. There's a separate JSON file for each 'scope' (e.g. `macrolanguage.json`) and 'type' (e.g. `language.json`). These files contain JSON objects keyed by tag or subtag and with the index integer for the corresponding entry in `registry.json` as a value. This makes lookups fast.\n\n## Updates ##\n\nThis project will be updated as the registry changes. Non-breaking updates will result in the patch version number being bumped.\n\nRun `make update` to force an update from the latest official IANA-hosted version. The registry file format is converted to JSON automatically and the files in `data/` are updated.\n\nIf there are changes, please make a pull request.\n\n## Usage ##\n\nSee [language-tags](https://github.com/mattcg/language-tags) for a Javascript API.\n\n## Credits and collaboration ##\n\nThe JSON database is licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal (CC0-1.0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode) license.\n\nComments, feedback and suggestions are welcome.

For formatting according to common conventions, see `tag.format`.\n\n### tags(tag) ###\n\nCheck whether a hyphen-separated tag is valid and well-formed. Always returns a `Tag`, which can be checked using the `valid` method.\n\n### tags.check(tag) ###\n\nShortcut for `tags(tag).valid()`. Return `true` if the tag is valid, `false` otherwise. For meaningful error output see `tag.errors()`.\n\n### tags.subtags(subtag), tags.subtags(subtags) ###\n\nLook up one or more subtags. Returns an array of `Subtag` objects. Returns an empty array if all of the subtags are non-existent.\n\nCalling `tags.subtags('mt')` will return an array with two `Subtag` objects: one for Malta (the 'region' type subtag) and one for Maltese (the 'language' type subtag).\n\n```\n> tags.subtags('mt');\n[Subtag, Subtag]\n> tags.subtags('bumblebee');\n[]\n```\n\nTo get or check a single subtag by type use `tags.language(subtag)`, `tags.region(subtag)` or `tags.type(subtag, type)`.\n\n### tags.filter(subtags) ###\n\nThe opposite of `tags.subtags(subtags)`. Returns an array of codes that are not registered subtags, otherwise returns an empty array.\n\n```\n> tags.filter(['en', 'Aargh']);\n['Aargh']\n```\n\n### tags.search(description, [all]) ###\n\nSearch for tags and subtags by description. Supports either a RegExp object or a string for `description`. Returns an array of `Subtag` and `Tag` objects or an empty array if no results were found.\n\nNote that `Tag` objects in the results represent 'grandfathered' or 'redundant' tags. These are excluded by default. Set the `all` parameter to `true` to include them.\n\nSearch is case-insensitive if `description` is a string.\n\n### tags.languages(macrolanguage) ###\n\nReturns an array of `Subtag` objects representing all the 'language' type subtags belonging to the given 'macrolanguage' type subtag.\n\nThrows an error if `macrolanguage` is not a macrolanguage.\n\n```\n> tags.languages('zh');\n[Subtag, Subtag...]\n> tags.languages('en');\nError: 'en' is not a valid macrolanguage.\n```\n\n### tags.language(subtag) ###\n\nConvenience method to get a single 'language' type subtag. Can be used to validate an input value as a language subtag. Returns a `Subtag` object or `null`.\n\n```\n> tags.language('en');\nSubtag\n> tags.language('us');\nnull\n```\n\n### tags.region(subtag) ###\n\nAs above, but with 'region' type subtags.\n\n```\n> tags.region('mt');\nSubtag\n> tags.region('en');\nnull\n```\n\n### tags.type(subtag, type) ###\n\nGet a subtag by type. Returns the subtag matching `type` as a `Subtag` object otherwise returns `null`.\n\nA `type` consists of one of the following strings: 'language', 'extlang', 'script', 'region' or 'variant'. To get a 'grandfathered' or 'redundant' type tag use `tags(tag)`.\n\n```\n> tags.type('zh', 'macrolanguage');\nSubtag\n> tags.type('zh', 'script');\nnull\n```\n\n### tags.date() ###\n\nReturns the file date for the underlying data, as a string.\n\n```\n> tags.date();\n'2004-06-28'\n```\n\n### Subtag ###\n\n#### subtag.type() ####\n\nGet the subtag type (either 'language', 'extlang', 'script', 'region' or 'variant'). See [RFC 5646 section 2.2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.2) for type definitions.\n\n#### subtag.descriptions() ####\n\nReturns an array of description strings (a subtag may have more than one description).\n\n```\n> tags.language('ro').descriptions();\n['Romanian', 'Moldavian', 'Moldovan']\n```\n\n#### subtag.preferred() ####\n\nReturns a preferred subtag as a `Subtag` object if the subtag is deprecated. For example, `ro` is preferred over deprecated `mo`.\n\n```\n> tags.language('mo').preferred();\nSubtag\n```\n\n#### subtag.script() ####\n\nFor subtags of type 'language' or 'extlang', returns a `Subtag` object representing the language's default script. See [RFC 5646 section 3.1.9](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-3.1.9) for a definition of 'Suppress-Script'.\n\n#### subtag.scope() ####\n\nReturns the subtag scope as a string, or `null` if the subtag has no scope.\n\nTip: if the subtag represents a macrolanguage, you can use `tags.languages(macrolanguage)` to get a list of all the macrolanguage's individual languages.\n\n```\n> tags.language('zh').scope();\n'macrolanguage'\n> tags.language('nah').scope();\n'collection'\n```\n\n#### subtag.deprecated() ####\n\nReturns a date string reflecting the deprecation date if the subtag is deprecated, otherwise returns `null`.\n\n```\n> tags.language('ja').deprecated();\n'2008-11-22'\n```\n\n#### subtag.added() ####\n\nReturns a date string reflecting the date the subtag was added to the registry.\n\n```\n> tags.language('ja').added();\n'2005-10-16'\n```\n\n#### subtag.comments() ####\n\nReturns an array of comments, if any, otherwise returns an empty array.\n\n```\n> tags.language('nmf').comments();\n['see ntx']\n```\n\n#### subtag.format() ####\n\nReturn the subtag code formatted according to the case conventions defined in [RFC 5646 section 2.1.1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.1.1).\n\n- language codes are made lowercase ('mn' for Mongolian)\n- script codes are made lowercase with the initial letter capitalized ('Cyrl' for Cyrillic)\n- country codes are capitalized ('MN' for Mongolia)\n\n### Tag ###\n\n#### tag.preferred() ####\n\nIf the tag is listed as 'deprecated' or 'redundant' it might have a preferred value. This method returns a `Tag` object if so.\n\n```\n> tags('zh-cmn-Hant').preferred();\nTag\n```\n\n#### tag.type() ####\n\nReturns `grandfathered` if the tag is grandfathered, `redundant` if the tag is redundant, and `tag` if neither. For a definition of grandfathered and redundant tags, see [RFC 5646 section 2.2.8](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.2.8).\n\n#### tag.subtags() ####\n\nReturns an array of subtags making up the tag, as `Subtag` objects.\n\n#### tag.language(), tag.region(), tag.script() ####\n\nShortcuts for `tag.find('language')`, `tag.find('region')` and `tag.find('script')`.\n\n#### tag.find(type) ####\n\nFind a subtag of the given type from those making up the tag.\n\n#### tag.valid() ####\n\nReturns `true` if the tag is valid, `false` otherwise.\n\n#### tag.errors() ####\n\nReturns an array of `Error` objects if the tag is invalid. The `message` property of each is readable and helpful enough for UI output. The `code` property can be checked against the `Tag.ERR_*` constants. Each error will also have either a `subtag` or `tag` property with the code of the offending tag.\n\n#### tag.format() ####\n\nFormat a tag according to the case conventions defined in [RFC 5646 section 2.1.1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.1.1).\n\n```\n> tags('en-gb').format();\n'en-GB'\n```\n\n#### tag.deprecated() ####\n\nFor grandfathered or redundant tags, returns a date string reflecting the deprecation date if the tag is deprecated.\n\n```\n> tags('zh-cmn-Hant').deprecated();\n'2009-07-29'\n```\n\n#### tag.added() ####\n\nFor grandfathered or redundant tags, returns a date string reflecting the date the tag was added to the registry.\n\n#### tag.descriptions() ####\n\nReturns an array of tag descriptions for grandfathered or redundant tags, otherwise returns an empty array.\n\n## Resources ##\n\n- [Python version by the Flanders Heritage Agency](https://github.com/OnroerendErfgoed/language-tags)\n- [Language Subtag Lookup tool by Richard Ishida](http://rishida.net/utils/subtags/)\n- [W3C Internationalization Checker](http://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/)\n- [RFC 5646](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646)\n\n## Credits and collaboration ##\n\nCopyright (c) 2013, [Matthew Caruana Galizia](http://twitter.com/mcaruanagalizia).\n\nThe software part of this project is licensed under an [MIT licence](http://mattcg.mit-license.org/).\n\nComments, feedback and suggestions are welcome.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

For example, you can set `level` to 2 to\nadd anchors to all headers but `h1`. You can also pass an array of\nheader levels to apply the anchor, like `[2, 3]` to have an anchor on\nonly level 2 and 3 headers.\n\nIf a `permalink` renderer is given, it will be called for each matching header\nto add a permalink. See [permalinks] below.\n\nIf a `slugify` function is given, you can decide how to transform a\nheading text to a URL slug. See [user-friendly URLs](#user-friendly-urls).\n\nThe `callback` option is a function that will be called at the end of\nrendering with the `token` and an `info` object.  The `info` object has\n`title` and `slug` properties with the token content and the slug used\nfor the identifier.\n\nWe set by default [`tabindex=\"-1\"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex)\non headers. This marks the headers as focusable elements that are not\nreachable by keyboard navigation. The effect is that screen readers will\nread the title content when it's being jumped to. Outside of screen\nreaders, the experience is the same as not setting that attribute. You\ncan override this behavior with the `tabIndex` option. Set it to `false`\nto remove the attribute altogether, otherwise the value will be used as\nattribute value.\n\nFinally, you can customize how the title text is extracted from the\nmarkdown-it tokens (to later generate the slug). See [user-friendly URLs](#user-friendly-urls).\n\n## User-friendly URLs\n\nStarting from v5.0.0, markdown-it-anchor dropped the [`string`](https://github.com/jprichardson/string.js)\npackage to retain our core value of being an impartial and secure\nlibrary. Nevertheless, users looking for backward compatibility may want\nthe old `slugify` function:\n\n```sh\nnpm install string\n```\n\n```js\nconst string = require('string')\nconst slugify = s => string(s).slugify().toString()\n\nconst md = require('markdown-it')()\n  .use(require('markdown-it-anchor'), { slugify })\n```\n\nAnother popular library for this is [`@sindresorhus/slugify`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/slugify),\nwhich have better Unicode support and other cool features:\n\n```sh\nnpm install @sindresorhus/slugify\n```\n\n```js\nconst slugify = require('@sindresorhus/slugify')\n\nconst md = require('markdown-it')()\n  .use(require('markdown-it-anchor'), { slugify: s => slugify(s) })\n```\n\nAdditionally, if you want to further customize the title that gets\npassed to the `slugify` function, you can do so by customizing the\n`getTokensText` function, that gets the plain text from a list of\nmarkdown-it inline tokens:\n\n```js\nfunction getTokensText (tokens) {\n  return tokens\n    .filter(token => !['html_inline', 'image'].includes(token.type))\n    .map(t => t.content)\n    .join('')\n}\n\nconst md = require('markdown-it')()\n  .use(require('markdown-it-anchor'), { getTokensText })\n```\n\nBy default we include only `text` and `code_inline` tokens, which\nappeared to be a sensible approach for the vast majority of use cases.\n\nAn alternative approach is to include every token's content except for\n`html_inline` and `image` tokens, which yields the exact same results as\nthe previous approach with a stock markdown-it, but would also include\ncustom tokens added by any of your markdown-it plugins, which might or\nmight not be desirable for you. Now you have the option!\n\n## Manually setting the `id` attribute\n\nYou might want to explicitly set the `id` attribute of your headings\nfrom the Markdown document, for example to keep them consistent across\ntranslations.\n\nmarkdown-it-anchor is designed to reuse any existing `id`, making [markdown-it-attrs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-attrs)\na perfect fit for this use case. Make sure to load it before markdown-it-anchor!\n\nThen you can do something like this:\n\n```markdown\n# Your title {#your-custom-id}\n```\n\nThe anchor link will reuse the `id` that you explicitly defined.\n\n## Compatible table of contents plugin\n\nLooking for an automatic table of contents (TOC) generator? Take a look at\n[markdown-it-toc-done-right](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-toc-done-right)\nit's made from the ground to be a great companion of this plugin.\n\n## Parsing headings from HTML blocks\n\nmarkdown-it-anchor doesn't parse HTML blocks, so headings defined in\nHTML blocks will be ignored. If you need to add anchors to both HTML\nheadings and Markdown headings, the easiest way would be to do it on the\nfinal HTML rather than during the Markdown parsing phase:\n\n```js\nconst { parse } = require('node-html-parser')\n\nconst root = parse(html)\n\nfor (const h of root.querySelectorAll('h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6')) {\n  const slug = h.getAttribute('id') || slugify(h.textContent)\n  h.setAttribute('id', slug)\n  h.innerHTML = `<a href=\"#${slug}>${h.innerHTML}</a>`\n}\n\nconsole.log(root.toString())\n```\n\nOr with a (not accessible) GitHub-style anchor, replace the\n`h.innerHTML` part with:\n\n```js\nh.insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', `<a class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#${slug}\">🔗</a> `)\n```\n\nWhile this still needs extra work like handling duplicated slugs and\nIDs, this should give you a solid base.\n\nThat said if you really want to use markdown-it-anchor for this even\nthough it's not designed to, you can do like npm does with their\n[marky-markdown](https://github.com/npm/marky-markdown) parser, and\n[transform the `html_block` tokens](https://github.com/npm/marky-markdown/blob/master/lib/plugin/html-heading.js)\ninto a sequence of `heading_open`, `inline`, and `heading_close` tokens\nthat can be handled by markdown-it-anchor:\n\n```js\nconst md = require('markdown-it')()\n  .use(require('@npmcorp/marky-markdown/lib/plugin/html-heading'))\n  .use(require('markdown-it-anchor'), opts)\n```\n\nWhile they use regexes to parse the HTML and it won't gracefully handle\nany arbitrary HTML, it should work okay for the happy path, which might\nbe good enough for you.\n\nYou might also want to check [this implementation](https://github.com/valeriangalliat/markdown-it-anchor/issues/105#issuecomment-907323858)\nwhich uses [Cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) for a more\nsolid parsing, including support for HTML attributes.\n\nThe only edge cases I see it failing with are multiple headings defined\nin the same HTML block with arbitrary content between them, or headings\nwhere the opening and closing tag are defined in separate `html_block`\ntokens, both which should very rarely happen.\n\nIf you need a bulletproof implementation, I would recommend the first\nHTML parser approach I documented instead.\n\n## Browser example\n\nSee [`example.html`](example.html).\n\n## Permalinks\n\nVersion 8.0.0 completely reworked the way permalinks work in order to\noffer more accessible options out of the box. You can also [make your own permalink](#custom-permalink).\n\nInstead of a single default way of rendering permalinks (which used to\nhave a poor UX on screen readers), we now have multiple styles of\npermalinks for you to chose from.\n\n```js\nconst anchor = require('markdown-it-anchor')\nconst md = require('markdown-it')()\n\nmd.use(anchor, {\n  permalink: anchor.permalink[styleOfPermalink](permalinkOpts)\n})\n```\n\nHere, `styleOfPermalink` is one of the available styles documented\nbelow, and `permalinkOpts` is an options object.\n\n<div id=\"common-options\"></div>\n\nAll renderers share a common set of options:\n\n| Name          | Description                                       | Default                            |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| `class`       | The class of the permalink anchor.                | `header-anchor`                    |\n| `symbol`      | The symbol in the permalink anchor.               | `#`                                |\n| `renderHref`  | A custom permalink `href` rendering function.     | See [`permalink.js`](permalink.js) |\n| `renderAttrs` | A custom permalink attributes rendering function. | See [`permalink.js`](permalink.js) |\n\nFor the `symbol`, you may want to use the [link symbol](http://graphemica.com/🔗),\nor a symbol from your favorite web font.\n\n### Header link\n\nThis style wraps the header itself in an anchor link. It doesn't use the\n`symbol` option as there's no symbol needed in the markup (though you\ncould add it with CSS using `::before` if you like).\n\nIt's so simple it doesn't have any behaviour to custom, and it's also\naccessible out of the box without any further configuration, hence it\ndoesn't have other options than the common ones described above.\n\nYou can find this style on the [MDN] as well as [HTTP Archive] and their\n[Web Almanac], which to me is a good sign that this is a thoughtful way of\nimplementing permalinks. This is also the style that I chose for my own\n[blog].\n\n[MDN]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web\n[HTTP Archive]: https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web\n[Web Almanac]: https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/table-of-contents\n[blog]: https://www.codejam.info/\n\n\n| Name              | Description                                                           | Default                               |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| `safariReaderFix` | Add a `span` inside the link so Safari shows headings in reader view. | `false` (for backwards compatibility) |\n|                   | See [common options](#common-options).                                |                                       |\n\n```js\nconst anchor = require('markdown-it-anchor')\nconst md = require('markdown-it')()\n\nmd.use(anchor, {\n  permalink: anchor.permalink.headerLink()\n})\n```\n\n```html\n<h2 id=\"title\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#title\">Title</a></h2>\n```\n\nThe main caveat of this approach is that you can't include links inside\nheaders. If you do, consider the other styles.\n\nAlso note that this pattern [breaks reader mode in Safari](https://www.leereamsnyder.com/blog/making-headings-with-links-show-up-in-safari-reader),\nan issue you can also notice on the referenced websites above. This was\nalready [reported to Apple](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225609#c2)\nbut their bug tracker is not public. In the meantime, a fix mentioned in\nthe article above is to insert a `span` inside the link. You can use the\n`safariReaderFix` option to enable it.\n\n```js\nconst anchor = require('markdown-it-anchor')\nconst md = require('markdown-it')()\n\nmd.use(anchor, {\n  permalink: anchor.permalink.headerLink({ safariReaderFix: true })\n})\n```\n\n```html\n<h2 id=\"title\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#title\"><span>Title</span></a></h2>\n```\n\n### Link after header\n\nIf you want to customize further the screen reader experience of your\npermalinks, this style gives you much more freedom than the [header link](#header-link).\n\nIt works by leaving the header itself alone, and adding the permalink\n*after* it, giving you different methods of customizing the assistive\ntext. It makes the permalink symbol `aria-hidden` to not pollute the\nexperience, and leverages a `visuallyHiddenClass` to hide the assistive\ntext from the visual experience.\n\n| Name                  | Description                                                                                               | Default                                                             |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `style`               | The (sub) style of link, one of `visually-hidden`, `aria-label`, `aria-describedby` or `aria-labelledby`. | `visually-hidden`                                                   |\n| `assistiveText`       | A function that takes the title and returns the assistive text.                                           | `undefined`, required for `visually-hidden` and `aria-label` styles |\n| `visuallyHiddenClass` | The class you use to make an element visually hidden.                                                     | `undefined`, required for `visually-hidden` style                   |\n| `space`               | Add a space between the assistive text and the permalink symbol.                                          | `true`                                                              |\n| `placement`           | Placement of the permalink symbol relative to the assistive text, can be `before` or `after` the header.  | `after`                                                             |\n| `wrapper`             | Opening and closing wrapper string, e.g. `['<div class=\"wrapper\">', '</div>']`.                           | `null`                                                              |\n|                       | See [common options](#common-options).                                                                    |                                                                     |\n\n```js\nconst anchor = require('markdown-it-anchor')\nconst md = require('markdown-it')()\n\nmd.use(anchor, {\n  permalink: anchor.permalink.linkAfterHeader({\n    style: 'visually-hidden',\n    assistiveText: title => `Permalink to “${title}”`,\n    visuallyHiddenClass: 'visually-hidden',\n    wrapper: ['<div class=\"wrapper\">', '</div>']\n  })\n})\n```\n\n```html\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n  <h2 id=\"title\">Title</h2>\n  <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#title\">\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Title”</span>\n    <span aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n  </a>\n</div>\n```\n\nBy using a visually hidden element for the assistive text, we make sure\nthat the assistive text can be picked up by translation services, as\nmost of the popular translation services (including Google Translate)\ncurrently ignore `aria-label`.\n\nIf you prefer an alternative method for the assistive text, see other\nstyles:\n\n<details>\n<summary><code>aria-label</code> variant</summary>\n\nThis removes the need from a visually hidden `span`, but will likely\nhurt the permalink experience when using a screen reader through a\ntranslation service.\n\n```js\nconst anchor = require('markdown-it-anchor')\nconst md = require('markdown-it')()\n\nmd.use(anchor, {\n  permalink: anchor.permalink.linkAfterHeader({\n    style: 'aria-label'\n    assistiveText: title => `Permalink to “${title}”`\n  })\n})\n```\n\n```html\n<h2 id=\"title\">Title</h2>\n<a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#title\" aria-label=\"Permalink to “Title”\">#</a>\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><code>aria-describedby</code> and <code>aria-labelledby</code> variants</summary>\n\nThis removes the need to customize the assistive text to your locale and\ndoesn't need a visually hidden `span` either, but since the anchor will\nbe described by just the text of the title without any context, it might\nbe confusing.\n\n```js\nconst anchor = require('markdown-it-anchor')\nconst md = require('markdown-it')()\n\nmd.use(anchor, {\n  permalink: anchor.permalink.linkAfterHeader({\n    style: 'aria-describedby' // Or `aria-labelledby`\n  })\n})\n```\n\n```html\n<h2 id=\"title\">Title</h2>\n<a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#title\" aria-describedby=\"title\">#</a>\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Link inside header\n\nThis is the equivalent of the default permalink in previous versions.\nThe reason it's not the first one in the list is because this method has\naccessibility issues.\n\nIf you use a symbol like just `#` without adding any markup around,\nscreen readers will read it as part of every heading (in the case of\n`#`, it could be read \"pound\", \"number\" or \"number sign\") meaning that\nif you title is \"my beautiful title\", it will read \"number sign my\nbeautiful title\" for example. For other common symbols, `🔗` is usually\nread as \"link symbol\" and `¶` as \"pilcrow\".\n\nAdditionally, screen readers users commonly request the list of all\nlinks in the page, so they'll be flooded with \"number sign, number sign,\nnumber sign\" for each of your headings.\n\nI would highly recommend using one of the markups above which have a\nbetter experience, but if you really want to use this markup, make sure\nto pass accessible HTML as `symbol` to make things usable, like in the\nexample below, but even that has some flaws.\n\nWith that said, this permalink allows the following options:\n\n| Name         | Description                                                                                                              | Default |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| `space`      | Add a space between the header text and the permalink symbol. Set it to a string to customize the space (e.g. `&nbsp;`). | `true`  |\n| `placement`  | Placement of the permalink, can be `before` or `after` the header. This option used to be called `permalinkBefore`.      | `after` |\n| `ariaHidden` | Whether to add `aria-hidden=\"true\"`, see [ARIA hidden](#aria-hidden).                                                    | `false` |\n|              | See [common options](#common-options).                                                                                   |         |\n\n```js\nconst anchor = require('markdown-it-anchor')\nconst md = require('markdown-it')()\n\nmd.use(anchor, {\n  permalink: anchor.permalink.linkInsideHeader({\n    symbol: `\n      <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Jump to heading</span>\n      <span aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n    `,\n    placement: 'before'\n  })\n})\n```\n\n```html\n<h2 id=\"title\">\n  <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#title\">\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Jump to heading</span>\n    <span aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n  </a>\n  Title\n</h2>\n```\n\nWhile this example allows more accessible anchors with the same markup\nas previous versions of markdown-it-anchor, it's still not ideal. The\nassistive text for permalinks will be read as part of the heading when\nlisting all the titles of the page, e.g. \"jump to heading title 1, jump\nto heading title 2\" and so on. Also that assistive text is not very\nuseful when listing the links in the page (which will read \"jump to\nheading, jump to heading, jump to heading\" for each of your permalinks).\n\n### ARIA hidden\n\nThis is just an alias for [`linkInsideHeader`](#link-inside-header) with\n`ariaHidden: true` by default, to mimic GitHub's way of rendering\npermalinks.\n\nSetting `aria-hidden=\"true\"` makes the permalink explicitly inaccessible\ninstead of having the permalink and its symbol being read by screen\nreaders as part of every single headings (which was a pretty terrible\nexperience).\n\n```js\nconst anchor = require('markdown-it-anchor')\nconst md = require('markdown-it')()\n\nmd.use(anchor, {\n  permalink: anchor.permalink.ariaHidden({\n    placement: 'before'\n  })\n})\n```\n\n```html\n<h2 id=\"title\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#title\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Title</h2>\n```\n\nWhile no experience might be arguably better than a bad experience, I\nwould instead recommend using one of the above renderers to provide an\naccessible experience. My favorite one is the [header link](#header-link),\nwhich is also the simplest one.\n\n### Custom permalink\n\nIf none of those options suit you, you can always make your own\nrenderer! Take inspiration from [the code behind all permalinks](permalink.js).\n\nThe signature of the function you pass in the `permalink` option is the\nfollowing:\n\n```js\nfunction renderPermalink (slug, opts, state, idx) {}\n```\n\nWhere `opts` are the markdown-it-anchor options, `state` is a\nmarkdown-it [`StateCore`](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)\ninstance, and `idx` is the index of the `heading_open` token in the\n`state.tokens` array. That array contains [`Token`](https://markdown-it.github.io/markdown-it/#Token)\nobjects.\n\nTo make sense of the \"token stream\" and the way token objects are\norganized, you will probably want to read the [markdown-it design principles](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/docs/architecture.md)\npage.\n\nThis function can freely modify the token stream (`state.tokens`),\nusually around the given `idx`, to construct the anchor.\n\nBecause of the way the token stream works, a `heading_open` token is\nusually followed by a `inline` token that contains the actual text (and\ninline markup) of the heading, and finally a `heading_close` token. This\nis why you'll see most built-in permalink renderers touch\n`state.tokens[idx + 1]`, because they update the contents of the\n`inline` token that follows a `heading_open`.\n\n## Debugging\n\nIf you want to debug this library more easily, we support source maps.\n\nUse the [source-map-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support)\nmodule to enable it with Node.js.\n\n```sh\nnode -r source-map-support/register your-script.js\n```\n\n## Development\n\n```sh\n# Build the library in the `dist/` directory.\nnpm run build\n\n# Watch file changes to update `dist/`.\nnpm run dev\n\n# Run tests, will use the build version so make sure to build after\n# making changes.\nnpm test\n```",

    "licenseText": "CC0 1.0 Universal\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and\nsubsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the\npurpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific\nworks (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear of later\nclaims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse\nand redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any\npurposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\nis so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,\nnon transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and\nunconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in\nthe Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\nprovided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\nin any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\npurpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\npromotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\n  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,\n  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\n  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or\n  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not\n  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation\n  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer\n  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions\n  or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n\n  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n  CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\n<http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>",

    "licenseText": "# metro-react-native-babel-preset\n\nBabel presets for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) applications. React Native itself uses this Babel preset by default when transforming your app's source code.\n\nIf you wish to use a custom Babel configuration by writing a `babel.config.js` file in your project's root directory, you must specify all the plugins necessary to transform your code. React Native does not apply its default Babel configuration in this case. So, to make your life easier, you can use this preset to get the default configuration and then specify more plugins that run before it.\n\n## Usage\n\nAs mentioned above, you only need to use this preset if you are writing a custom `babel.config.js` file.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall `metro-react-native-babel-preset` in your app:\n\nwith `npm`:\n\n```sh\nnpm i metro-react-native-babel-preset --save-dev\n```\n\nor with `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add -D metro-react-native-babel-preset\n```\n\n### Configuring Babel\n\nThen, create a file called `babel.config.js` in your project's root directory. The existence of this `babel.config.js` file will tell React Native to use your custom Babel configuration instead of its own. Then load this preset:\n\n```\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"module:metro-react-native-babel-preset\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can further customize your Babel configuration by specifying plugins and other options. See [Babel's `babel.config.js` documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files/) to learn more.\n\n## Help and Support\n\nIf you get stuck configuring Babel, please ask a question on Stack Overflow or find a consultant for help. If you discover a bug, please open up an issue.",

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# `react-devtools-core`\n\nThis package provides low-level APIs to support renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). If you're looking for the standalone React DevTools UI, **we suggest using [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) instead of using this package directly**.\n\nThis package provides two entrypoints: labeled \"backend\" and \"standalone\" (frontend). Both APIs are described below.\n\n# Backend API\n\nBackend APIs are embedded in _development_ builds of renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) in order to connect to the React DevTools UI.\n\n### Example\n\nIf you are building a non-browser-based React renderer, you can use the backend API like so:\n\n```js\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n  const { connectToDevTools } = require(\"react-devtools-core\");\n\n  // Must be called before packages like react or react-native are imported\n  connectToDevTools({\n    ...config\n  });\n}\n```\n\n> **NOTE** that this API (`connectToDevTools`) must be (1) run in the same context as React and (2) must be called before React packages are imported (e.g. `react`, `react-dom`, `react-native`).\n\n### `connectToDevTools` options\n| Prop | Default | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `host` | `\"localhost\"` | Socket connection to frontend should use this host. |\n| `isAppActive` |  | (Optional) function that returns true/false, telling DevTools when it's ready to connect to React. |\n| `port` | `8097` | Socket connection to frontend should use this port. |\n| `resolveRNStyle` |  | (Optional) function that accepts a key (number) and returns a style (object); used by React Native. |\n| `retryConnectionDelay` | `200` | Delay (ms) to wait between retrying a failed Websocket connection |\n| `useHttps` | `false` | Socket connection to frontend should use secure protocol (wss). |\n| `websocket` |  | Custom `WebSocket` connection to frontend; overrides `host` and `port` settings. |\n\n# Frontend API\n\nFrontend APIs can be used to render the DevTools UI into a DOM node. One example of this is [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) which wraps DevTools in an Electron app.\n\n### Example\n```js\nimport DevtoolsUI from \"react-devtools-core/standalone\";\n\n// See the full list of API methods in documentation below.\nconst { setContentDOMNode, startServer } = DevtoolsUI;\n\n// Render DevTools UI into a DOM element.\nsetContentDOMNode(document.getElementById(\"container\"));\n\n// Start socket server used to communicate between backend and frontend.\nstartServer(\n  // Port defaults to 8097\n  1234,\n\n  // Host defaults to \"localhost\"\n  \"example.devserver.com\",\n\n  // Optional config for secure socket (WSS).\n  {\n    key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem'),\n    cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem')\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### Exported methods\nThe `default` export is an object defining the methods described below.\n\nThese methods support chaining for convenience. For example:\n```js\nconst DevtoolsUI = require(\"react-devtools-core/standalone\");\nDevtoolsUI.setContentDOMNode(element).startServer();\n```\n\n#### `connectToSocket(socket: WebSocket)`\n> This is an advanced config function that is typically not used.\n\nCustom `WebSocket` connection to use for communication between DevTools frontend and backend. Calling this method automatically initializes the DevTools UI (similar to calling `startServer()`).\n\n#### `openProfiler()`\nAutomatically select the \"Profiler\" tab in the DevTools UI.\n\n#### `setContentDOMNode(element: HTMLElement)`\nSet the DOM element DevTools UI should be rendered into on initialization.\n\n#### `setDisconnectedCallback(callback: Function)`\n_Optional_ callback to be notified when DevTools `WebSocket` closes (or errors).\n\n#### `setProjectRoots(roots: Array<string>)`\n_Optional_ set of root directories for source files. These roots can be used to open an inspected component's source code using an IDE.\n\n#### `setStatusListener(callback: Function)`\n_Optional_ callback to be notified of socket server events (e.g. initialized, errored, connected).\n\nThis callback receives two parameters:\n```js\nfunction onStatus(\n  message: string,\n  status: 'server-connected' | 'devtools-connected' | 'error'\n): void {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n#### `startServer(port?: number, host?: string, httpsOptions?: Object, loggerOptions?: Object)`\nStart a socket server (used to communicate between backend and frontend) and renders the DevTools UI.\n\nThis method accepts the following parameters:\n| Name | Default | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `port` | `8097` | Socket connection to backend should use this port. |\n| `host` | `\"localhost\"` | Socket connection to backend should use this host. |\n| `httpsOptions` | | _Optional_ object defining `key` and `cert` strings. |\n| `loggerOptions` | | _Optional_ object defining a `surface` string (to be included with DevTools logging events). |\n\n# Development\n\nWatch for changes made to the backend entry point and rebuild:\n```sh\nyarn start:backend\n```\n\nWatch for changes made to the standalone UI entry point and rebuild:\n```sh\nyarn start:standalone\n```\n\nRun the standalone UI using `yarn start` in the [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools).",

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Please use linebyline instead, it is the same module just renamed:\n[Npm linebyline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linebyline)\n\n```sh\nnpm install linebyline\n```\n\n## Test\n```sh\nnpm install .\nnpm test\n\n```\n\n\n## What's this?\n\nSimple streaming readline module for NodeJS. Reads a file and buffers new lines emitting a _line_ event for each line.\n\n## Usage\n### Simple\n```js\n  var readline = require('linebyline'),\n      rl = readline('./somefile.txt');\n  rl.on('line', function(line, lineCount, byteCount) {\n    // do something with the line of text\n  })\n  .on('error', function(e) {\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n```\n\n### ASCII file decoding\nAs the underlying `fs.createReadStream` doesn't care about the specific ASCII encoding of the file, an alternative way to decode the file is by telling the `readline` library to retain buffer and then decoding it using a converter (e.g. [`iconv-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iconv-lite)).\n```js\n  var readline = require('linebyline'),\n      rl = readline('./file-in-win1251.txt', {\n    retainBuffer: true //tell readline to retain buffer \n  });\n  rl.on(\"line\", function (data,linecount){\n    var line = iconv.decode(data, 'win1251');\n    // do something with the line of converted text\n  });\n```\n##API\n## readLine(readingObject[, options])\n### Params:\n\n* `readingObject` - file path or stream object\n* `options` can include:\n  * `maxLineLength` - override the default 4K buffer size (lines longer than this will not be read)\n  * `retainBuffer` - avoid converting to String prior to emitting 'line' event; will pass raw buffer with encoded data to the callback\n\n### Return:\n\n* **EventEmitter** \n\n\n## License\n\nBSD © [Craig Brookes](http://craigbrookes.com/)",

Usage: `safeJsonStringify.ensureProperties(data);`.\n\n\nWhy?\n----\nThe `stringify` function on the JavaScript JSON object will take any data and return a string representation of said data. If this data contains an object literal it will attempt to return the values of any enumerable property set on this object. This can be dangerous because JavaScript supports a couple of ways to define property getters on objects.\n\nThe old, non-standard, and now deprecated `Object.prototype.__defineGetter__()` will define a named property which value is the return of a given function.\n\n```js\n// Never ever do this in your code. Please.\nvar obj = {};\nobj.__defineGetter__('foo', function() { return 'bar'; });\n\nJSON.stringify(obj); // {\"foo\":\"bar\"}\n```\n\nThis is kinda bad because we could make that function throw an error.\n\n```js\n// Never ever do this in your code. Please.\nvar obj = {};\nobj.__defineGetter__('foo', function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); });\n\nJSON.stringify(obj); // error thrown\n```\n\nThis property is created as an enumerable on the object, so the object from the previous example would make any function that iterates choke and throw an error. This is bad because one would never expect a simple property get to throw an error and bring down a system.\n\n`JSON.stringify` will blindly trust any object property, and will throw an error if it hits a defined property that throws an error. This could potentially take down your program.\n\nThe slightly better `Object.defineProperty()` does the same thing, but has the common courtesy to not define the getter as enumerable--that is per default. The following example would bring us in the same situation as with `__defineGetter__`.\n\n```js\n// Never ever do this in your code. Please.\nvar obj = {};\nObject.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', {\n    get: function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); },\n        enumerable: true // enumerable is false by default\n});\n\nJSON.stringify(obj); // error thrown\n```\n\nSo, we can not trust any of them. One could argue that they should never be used, and we can, and should, apply that principle to our own software, but we cannot trust code from third-party modules. If data from third-party modules are to be stringified by JSON we should take these situations into considerations. This module attempt to do that by spotting defined getters and return \"[Throws]\" if said getter throws an error.\n\n```js\nvar safeJsonStringify = require('safe-json-stringify');\n// Never ever do this in your code. Please.\nvar obj = {};\nObject.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', {\n    get: function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); },\n        enumerable: true\n});\n\nsafeJsonStringify(obj); // '{\"foo\":\"[Throws]\"}'\n```\n\nAnd it attempts to handle circular references too. It returns \"[Circular]\" if it spots one.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014-2017 [Debitoor](https://debitoor.com/)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Useful for test code, debugging, and a wide range of other utilities.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n[![NPM][badge-npm-img]][badge-npm-url]\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo use the stream buffers in your module, simply import it and away you go.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar streamBuffers = require(\"stream-buffers\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Writable StreamBuffer\r\n\r\nWritable Stream Buffers implement the standardized writable stream interface. All write()'s to this object will accumulate in an internal Buffer. If the Buffer overflows it will be resized larger automatically. The initial size of the Buffer and the amount in which it grows can be configured in the constructor.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myWritableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.WritableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tinitialSize: (100 * 1024),\t\t// start as 100 kilobytes.\r\n\tincrementAmount: (10 * 1024)\t// grow by 10 kilobytes each time buffer overflows.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default initial size and increment amount are stored in the following constants:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE \t\t// (8 * 1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INCREMENT_AMOUNT\t// (8 * 1024)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWriting is standard Stream stuff:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(myBuffer);\r\n// - or -\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"\\u00bd + \\u00bc = \\u00be\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can query the size of the data being held in the Buffer, and also how big the Buffer's max capacity currently is: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nstreamBuffers.size();\t\t\t// 4.\r\nstreamBuffers.maxSize();\t\t// Whatever was configured as initial size. In our example: (100 * 1024).\r\n```\r\n\r\nRetrieving the contents of the Buffer is simple:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t\t\t\t// Gets all held data as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\");\t\t// Gets all held data as a utf8 string.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(5);\t\t\t\t\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\", 5);\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a utf8 string.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCare should be taken when getting encoded strings from WritableStream, as it doesn't really care about the contents (multi-byte characters will not be respected).\r\n \r\nDestroying or ending the WritableStream will not delete the contents of Buffer, but will disallow any further writes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.destroy();\r\n\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t// Returns ASDF in Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"Yeah?\");\t\t// No effect.\r\n```\t\r\n\r\n### Readable StreamBuffer\r\n\r\nReadable Stream Buffers can have data inserted in them, which will then be pumped out via standard readable stream data events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a WritableStream Buffer does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it's being pumped out. \r\n\r\nThe frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tfrequency: 10,\t\t// in milliseconds.\r\n\tchunkSize: 2048\t\t// in bytes.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefault frequency and chunk size:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE \t\t// (1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY\t\t\t// (1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPutting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer);\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out via standard readable stream spec: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\t// Yup.\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out by the interval that you specified in frequency. Setting the frequency to 0 will immediately stream the data (also in chunks), even if the stream has not been piped to a destination. This is useful for unit testing. \r\n\r\nsetEncoding() for streams is respected too:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.setEncoding(\"utf8\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof String);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nPause and resume are also implemented. pause()'ing stream will allow buffer to continue accumulating, but will not pump any of that data out until it is resume()'d again. \r\n\r\nDestroying the stream will immediately purge the buffer, unless destroySoon() is called, in which case the rest of the buffer will be written out. Either way, any further attempts to put data in the Buffer will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.destroySoon();\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String!\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.size();\t\t\t// will be 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nNot supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases. It works with an internal buffer that it copies contents to/from/around.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nThanks to the following people for taking some time to contribute to this project.\r\n\r\n * Igor Dralyuk <idralyuk@ebay.com>\r\n * Simon Koudijs <simon.koudijs@intellifi.nl>\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nnode-stream-buffer is free and unencumbered public domain software.

You receive two events `reading` and `writing`-- no magic is performed.\n\nThis works well with [duplexify](https://github.com/mafintosh/duplexify) or lazy streams, so you can wait until you know you're being used as a stream to do something asynchronous, such as fetching an API token.\n\n\n## Use\n```sh\n$ npm install --save stream-events\n```\n```js\nvar stream = require('stream')\nvar streamEvents = require('stream-events')\nvar util = require('util')\n\nfunction MyStream() {\n  stream.Duplex.call(this)\n  streamEvents.call(this)\n}\nutil.inherits(MyStream, stream.Duplex)\n\nMyStream.prototype._read = function(chunk) {\n  console.log('_read called as usual')\n  this.push(new Buffer(chunk))\n  this.push(null)\n}\n\nMyStream.prototype._write = function() {\n  console.log('_write called as usual')\n}\n\nvar stream = new MyStream\n\nstream.on('reading', function() {\n  console.log('stream is being asked for data')\n})\n\nstream.on('writing', function() {\n  console.log('stream is being sent data')\n})\n\nstream.pipe(stream)\n```\n\n### Using with Duplexify\n```js\nvar duplexify = require('duplexify')\nvar streamEvents = require('stream-events')\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\nvar dup = streamEvents(duplexify())\n\ndup.on('writing', function() {\n  // do something async\n  dup.setWritable(/*writable stream*/)\n})\n\nfs.createReadStream('file').pipe(dup)\n```",

    "description": "Implementation of RFC8941, structured headers for HTTP.",
    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "Structured Headers parser for Javascript\n========================================\n\nThis library is a parser and serializer for the [Structured Headers][1]\nspecification, a.k.a. \"Structured Field Values for HTTP\" (RFC8941).\n\nThis specification defines a standard serialization for complex HTTP header\nvalues, including lists (arrays), dictionaries (maps) and also numbers,\nbooleans, and binary data.\n\nThe library is written in Typescript, and the examples in this document are\ntoo, but plain Javascript is also fully supported.\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nThis package has 2725 unittests, the vast majority are supplied from the\nofficial [HTTP WG test suite][2].\n\nHowever, there are 2 differences in the serializer:\n\n1. Javascript can't differentiate between `1.0` and `1`. As a result we're\n   skipping the tests that require a serialiation output of `1.0`.\n2. Javascript rounds slightly different from the spec. The tests suggest that\n   `0.0025` should round to the nearest event number (`0.002`), but Javascript\n   rounds to `0.003`.\n\nNo fix is planned for #1, because there's no reasonably way to fix this\nwithout wrapping every number in a custom class, and this will negatively\nimpact the developer experience. We do intend to fix #2 in the future with a\ncustom rounding algorithm.\n\nThis library emits and expects the _exact_ data structures as they are\nsuggested by the RFC. The result of this is that the returned types can be\na bit complex.\n\nIn the future we intend to loosen the required types for the serializer, and\nadd new helper functions that give you simpler structures _if_ you don't need\ncertain features for a header (such as `Parameters`).\n\nLet us know what you would like to see here!\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nUsing npm:\n\n```\nnpm install structured-headers\n```\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### Parsing an item\n\nThe following are examples of `item` headers:\n\nParsed as string\n\n```\n# Parsed as string\nHeader: \"foo\"\n\n# A simple string, called a 'Token' in the spec\nHeader: foo\n\n# Parsed as number\nHeader: 5\nHeader: -10\nHeader: 5.01415\n\n# Parsed into boolean\nHeader: ?1\nHeader: ?0\n\n# Binaries are base64 encoded\nHeader: :RE0gbWUgZm9yIGEgZnJlZSBjb29raWU=:\n\n# Items can have parameters\nHeader: \"Hello world\"; a=\"5\"\n```\n\n\nTo parse these header values, use the `parseItem`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { parseItem } from 'structured-headers';\n\nconsole.log(\n  parseItem(header)\n);\n```\n\nparseItem returns a tuple (array with 2 items), the first item is the value,\nthe second is a `Map` object with parameters.\n\nThe type is roughly:\n\n```typescript\n\n// The raw value\ntype BareItem = number | string | Token | ByteSequence | boolean;\n\n// The return type of parseItem\ntype Item = [\n  BareItem,\n  Map<string, BareItem>\n];\n```\n\n### Parsing a list\n\nA list is an array of items. Some examples:\n\n```\n# A simple list\nHeader: 5, \"foo\", bar, ?1\n\n# Each element can have parameters\nHeader: sometoken; param1; param2=hi, 42\n\n# A list can also contain lists itself. These are called 'inner lists' and\n# use parenthesis\nHeader: sometoken, (innerlistitem1 innerlistitem2), (anotherlist)\n```\n\n\nTo parse these:\n\n```typescript\nimport { parseList } from 'structured-headers';\n\nconsole.log(\n  parseList(header)\n);\n```\n\n`parseList` returns an array with each member. The return type is:\n\n```typescript\ntype InnerList = [Item[], Parameters];\ntype List = (InnerList|Item)[];\n```\n\n### Parsing a dictionary\n\nA dictionary is a key->value object. Examples:\n\n```\n# A simple dictionary\nHeader: fn=\"evert\", ln=\"pot\", coffee=?1\n\n# Each item may have parameters too\nHeader: foo=123; q=1, bar=123, q=0.5\n\n# A dictionary value may be an inner list again\nHeader: foo=(1 2 3)\n```\n\nTo parse dictionaries:\n\n```typescript\nimport { parseDictionary } from 'structured-headers';\n\nconsole.log(\n  parseDictionary(header)\n);\n```\n\nThe return type for `parseDictionary` is a `Map`.\n\n```typescript\ntype Dictionary = Map<string, Item|InnerList>;\n```\n\n\n### Serializing\n\nThe serialiser functions work the exact same way, but in opposite direction.\nThey all return strings.\n\nCurrently the serializes expect the *exact type* that the parsers return, but\nthe intention is to loosen the types for serialization, so it's a bit more\nergnomic to call. Want this? Let me know by opening an issue.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport {\n  serializeDictionary,\n  serializeList,\n  serializeItem\n} from 'structured-headers';\n\n\n// Returns \"foo\", \"bar\"\nserializeList([\n  ['foo', new Map()],\n  ['bar', new Map()],\n]);\n\n// Returns a=1, b=?0\nsh.serializeDictionary(new Map([\n  ['a', [1, new Map()]],\n  ['b', [false, new Map()]],\n]));\n\n// Returns 42\nserializeItem([42, new Map()]);\n\n// Returns 5.5\nserializeItem([5.5, new Map()]);\n\n// Returns \"hello world\"\nserializeItem([\"hello world\", new Map()]);\n\n// Returns ?1\nserializeItem([true, new Map()]);\n\n// Returns a base-64 representation like: *aGVsbG8=*\nserializeItem([new ByteSequence('aGVsbG8='), new Map()]);\n```\n\nBrowser support\n---------------\n\nThere is a minified version of this library in the `browser/` directory. This minified\nfile will expose a global variable called 'structuredHeader' which contains the rest\nof the api.\n\n\n[1]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8941\n[2]: https://github.com/httpwg/structured-field-tests",

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.",

Trademarks.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\r\n\r\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
